# SpectraLab Tutorial — Step-by-Step Walkthroughs

## 1. Getting Started

### Opening SpectraLab

Open `index.html` in any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari). No installation or server is required — SpectraLab runs entirely in the browser.

### Interface Overview

When SpectraLab opens, you see:

- **Left sidebar** — all controls, file operations, and settings
- **Main canvas** — the image display and editing area (center)
- **Four tabs** at the top of the sidebar: **View**, **Edit**, **Xform**, **Sprites**

The **View** tab is active by default — this is where you control display settings.

### Loading Your First File

You can load a file in two ways:
1. Click the **file input** at the top of the sidebar and browse for a file
2. **Drag and drop** a file directly onto the canvas

SpectraLab supports many formats: `.scr`, `.53c`, `.atr`, `.bsc`, `.bsp`, `.bmc4`, `.ifl`, `.mlt`, `.mc`, `.3`, `.img`, `.hlr`, `.stl`, `.nxi`, `.sl2`, `.specscii`, `.sca`, `.sna`, `.z80`, `.zip`, `.png`, `.gif`, `.jpg`, `.webp`, `.bmp`.

## 2. Viewing ZX Spectrum Images

### Open a .scr File

Load a standard `.scr` file by clicking the file input or dragging it anywhere onto the window. The image will appear at the default zoom of x2.

### Change Zoom Level

- Use the **Zoom** dropdown in the View tab (x1 through x20)
- Press keys **1-5** for quick zoom levels
- Use **Ctrl+Mouse Wheel** to zoom in/out (works anywhere in the canvas panel area; Ctrl+Wheel over the left sidebar performs normal browser zoom)

### Rotate the Display

- Use the **Rotate** dropdown (next to Zoom) to rotate the canvas by **0°, 90°, 180°, or 270°**
- This is purely visual — drawing tools, load/save, and export are not affected
- All editor tools work correctly at any rotation angle

### Toggle Grid Overlay

1. Expand the **Grid** section (click the header)
2. Set the **Paper grid** dropdown to **8px** to see the 8×8 character cell grid
3. Optionally set a **subgrid** (e.g., 2px or 4px) for finer divisions
4. Or press **G** to cycle through grid sizes (None → 8 → 16 → 24px)

### Change Grid Color

If the grid is hard to see against dark or light artwork:
1. In the **Grid** section, find the **Grid color** dropdown
2. Select a color preset: **White**, **Gray**, **Black**, **Orange**, **Red**, or **Green**
3. **Default** uses the standard blue grid color

### Change Palette

Select a different display palette from the **Palette** dropdown in View Settings. Different palettes simulate different monitor characteristics and color profiles.

### Load Custom Palette from File

1. Click the 📂 button next to the **Palette** dropdown
2. Select a text file (`.txt`, `.pal`, or `.csv`) containing 15 or 16 color definitions
3. Each line defines one color: `#RRGGBB`, `RRGGBB`, `#AARRGGBB`, `AARRGGBB` (alpha ignored), or `R G B` decimal (0-255)
4. Lines 1-8 define regular colors, lines 9-16 define bright colors (with 15 colors, black is auto-prepended)
5. Comments (`;` or `//`) and blank lines are skipped
6. The palette appears as "Custom (loaded)" in the dropdown
7. To revert, select any built-in palette from the dropdown, or reload the page

### Change Border Color and Size

1. Select a **Border** color: Black, Blue, Red, Magenta, Green, Cyan, Yellow, or White
2. Select a **Border size**: None, Small (16px), or Medium (32px)

### Toggle Flash Animation

- Check/uncheck the **Flash** checkbox, or press **F**
- Flash causes ink and paper colors to swap on cells with the flash attribute enabled

### Display Filters (CRT Effects)

1. In the **Tools** tab, expand the **Display Filters** section
2. Check the **On** checkbox to enable
3. Choose a preset: **CRT TV**, **Composite**, **VHS**, or **Arcade**
4. Or adjust individual filters: Scanlines, Noise, Composite, Glow, Vignette, Curvature, Smoothing
5. Settings persist across sessions

### View File Info

Expand the **File Info** section to see the file name, size, format, and dimensions. Additional counters update live during editing: **Colors used** shows distinct colors (attribute values for ZX formats, palette indices for NXI/LoRes); **Hidden cells** shows cells where ink equals paper but the bitmap has an invisible pattern (not shown for attribute-only formats like GMX 160, HLR, 53c, STL).

## 3. Creating a New Picture

1. Click the **New** button (next to Save)
2. In the New Picture dialog, select a format from the dropdown:
   - **Screen (.scr)** is the most common choice — 256×192 pixels with 8×8 color attributes
   - Choose other formats for specific needs (ULA+ for 64 colors, IFL/MLT for multicolor, HLR/STL for low-res gigascreen, etc.)
   - **chr$ (.ch$)** — variable-size interleaved 8x8 cell format
   - **ZXP (.zxp)** — variable-size picture (8-2048px) with ULA or ULA+ palette
3. Click **Create**

The editor automatically switches to the **Edit** tab with a blank canvas ready for drawing.

### Understanding the Blank Canvas

A standard SCR picture has:
- **256×192 pixels** of bitmap data
- **32×24 character cells** (each 8×8 pixels) for color attributes
- Each cell can have one **ink** color and one **paper** color (from 8 colors × 2 brightness levels)

![New picture](screenshots/tutorial_new_picture.png)

## 4. Basic Drawing

### Select Colors

1. In the **Edit** tab, click a color in the palette bar to set the **ink** (foreground) color
2. Right-click a color to set the **paper** (background) color
3. The selected ink is marked with **I**, paper with **P**

### Draw with the Pixel Tool

The **Pixel** tool (P) is selected by default:
- **Left-click** on the canvas to draw with ink
- **Right-click** to draw with paper

### Use Line, Rectangle, and Circle Tools

1. Press **L** for Line, **R** for Rectangle, or **O** for Circle/Ellipse
2. Click and drag on the canvas to draw the shape
3. **Left-click** draws with ink, **right-click** draws with paper

### Shape Modifiers

While drawing rectangles or circles:
- Hold **Ctrl** — constrain to perfect square or circle (1:1 ratio)
- Hold **Alt** — draw from center instead of corner
- Hold **Ctrl+Alt** — perfect square/circle from center

### Pick Colors from Canvas

Press **K** to select the Color Picker tool, then:
- **Left-click** on the canvas to pick the ink color from that cell
- **Right-click** to pick the paper color
- Or hold **Alt** and click with any tool for a quick eyedropper

### Understanding Attribute Cells

ZX Spectrum screens have a fundamental constraint: each 8×8 pixel cell can only use **two colors** (ink and paper). If you draw a third color into a cell, the entire cell changes its ink or paper attribute.

This is not a bug — it's how the original ZX Spectrum hardware works. The 8×8 grid overlay (enable it with **G**) helps you see cell boundaries.

![Basic drawing](screenshots/tutorial_basic_drawing.png)

## 5. Working with Colors

### Select Ink Color
Click a color in the palette bar. It will be marked with **I** (ink).

### Select Paper Color
Right-click a color in the palette bar. It will be marked with **P** (paper).

### Toggle Bright
Press **B** or check the **Bright** checkbox. Bright mode selects the high-intensity version of the 8 base colors, giving you 16 total colors (but bright applies to both ink and paper in each cell).

### Toggle Flash
Press **F** or check the **Flash** checkbox. Flash makes ink and paper colors swap periodically in the affected cell.

### Swap Ink and Paper
Press **X** to swap the current ink and paper colors.

### Eyedropper
Hold **Alt** and click on the canvas to pick up the ink and paper colors from that cell. This is very useful when you want to match existing colors.

### Understanding Attribute Conflicts
Each 8×8 cell can only have one ink color and one paper color (plus one brightness state). When you draw across cells, the attribute (ink/paper/bright) is applied to each cell you touch. Planning your drawing around the 8×8 grid is a fundamental ZX Spectrum art skill.

## 6. Using Brushes

### Change Brush Shape

In the **Brush** section of the Edit tab, click a shape button:
- ■ Square, ● Round, — HLine, | VLine, / Stroke, \\ BStroke

### Change Brush Size

- Use the **Size** dropdown (1 to 16 pixels)
- Or press **[** to decrease and **]** to increase brush size

### Capture Custom Brush from Screen

1. Expand the **Custom Brushes** section
2. **Shift+click** on an empty brush slot — this enters capture mode
3. Click and drag on the canvas to select the area to capture
4. The captured brush appears in the slot

### Use a Custom Brush

1. Click the slot with the captured brush to select it
2. Draw on the canvas — the custom brush pattern is used as a stamp

### Clear a Brush Slot

**Ctrl+click** on a brush slot to clear it.

### Save and Load Brush Sets

Use the **Save** (💾) and **Load** (📂) buttons above the brush slots:
- Save as `.slb` format (custom brushes)
- Load `.slb` files or `.768`/`.bin` tileset files

![Using brushes](screenshots/tutorial_brushes.png)

---

## 7. Flood Fill and Cell Fill

### Flood Fill (I)

1. Press **I** to select the Flood Fill tool
2. Click on a pixel — all connected pixels of the same color will be filled with the current ink
3. Right-click to fill with paper color

### Cell Fill (C)

1. Press **C** to select the Fill Cell tool
2. Click on any cell — the entire 8×8 character cell is filled with ink pixels
3. Right-click to fill the cell with paper pixels

### Attribute Recolor (A)

1. Press **A** to switch to Recolor mode
2. Click on cells to change their ink/paper/bright attributes without modifying the bitmap pixels
3. This is useful for recoloring existing artwork

### Cell Invert (J)

1. Press **J** to switch to Cell Invert mode
2. Click (or drag across) cells to swap their ink↔paper and invert the bitmap simultaneously
3. The displayed colors remain identical — only the polarity changes (which pixels are "ink" vs "paper")
4. Useful for manually fixing individual cells in converted images where ink/paper assignment is suboptimal

![Fill tools](screenshots/tutorial_fill.png)

---

## 8. Selection and Clipboard

### Select an Area

1. Press **S** or click the Select (⬚) button in the Xform tab
2. Click and drag on the canvas to define a selection rectangle
3. The selection is shown with a cyan outline

### Copy and Cut

- **Ctrl+C** — copy the selection to clipboard
- **Ctrl+X** — cut the selection (copy + erase original)

### Paste

1. Press **Ctrl+V** to enter paste mode
2. A semi-transparent preview follows your cursor
3. Click to place the pasted content
4. While pasting, use these keys to transform:
   - **R** — rotate 90° clockwise
   - **H** — flip horizontally
   - **V** — flip vertically
5. Press **Escape** to cancel paste mode

### Invert Selection

Press **N** to invert the selection — this swaps ink and paper colors.

### Snap to Grid

Enable **Snap to grid** in the Xform tab to align paste positions to the 8×8 grid.

![Selection and paste](screenshots/tutorial_selection.png)

---

## 9. Using Undo/Redo

- **Ctrl+Z** — undo the last action (up to 32 levels)
- **Ctrl+Y** — redo an undone action
- You can also click the **Undo** and **Redo** buttons in the Xform tab

The undo history is preserved as long as the picture is open. Creating a new picture or loading a different file resets the history.

---

## 10. Adding Text

1. Press **T** or click the Text tool button
2. The **Text** section appears in the Edit tab
3. Type your text in the input field
4. Select a font:
   - **ROM (Spectrum)** — the default ZX Spectrum 8×8 font
   - Click **.768** to load a ZX Spectrum bitmap font (`.768`, `.ch8` format)
   - Click **TTF** to load a TrueType/OpenType font
5. Select font size: 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, or 32
6. Click on the canvas to place the text at that position
7. Text is drawn with the current ink color on the current paper

![Adding text](screenshots/tutorial_text.png)

## 11. Importing External Images

### Open the Import Dialog

When you load a `.png`, `.gif`, `.jpg`, `.webp`, or `.bmp` file, the Image Import dialog opens automatically.

The dialog shows two canvases side by side — ORIGINAL (source) and PREVIEW (converted result). Each has a zoom dropdown (Fit, x1–x4 for source; Fit, x1–x5 for preview). Both canvases have a **Grid** checkbox — the source grid shows 8×8 pixel boundaries within the crop rectangle, while the preview grid shows attribute cell boundaries on the output. Scrollbars appear when zoomed images exceed the available space.

### Choose Target Format

In the **Output** section, select the target ZX Spectrum format (SCR, ULA+, IFL, MLT, MLT+ULA+, Gigascreen, Gigaattr, GAP, GAP Dual, HLR, STL, GMX 640×200, GMX 160×200, SPECSCII, ZXP, btile, wtile, etc.).

For **SPECSCII** format, the **Charset** dropdown selects which glyphs are used: **Full** (ROM font + block graphics), **ASCII** (ROM font only), or **UDG** (block graphics only).

For **ZXP** format, you can specify custom width and height (8-2048 pixels, divisible by 8) and choose between ULA and ULA+ palette types.

For **btile** / **wtile** formats (Nirvana engine tiles), you can specify custom canvas size. Width snaps to tile-aligned values (multiples of 16 for btile, 24 for wtile) and height to multiples of 16. Uses 8×2 multicolor attribute cells.

For **MLT+ULA+** format, the ULA+ Palette controls appear — choose **Auto** to generate an optimal 64-color palette from the source image, or **Load .pal** to supply a custom palette file.

For **GMX 640×200** and **GMX 160×200** (Scorpion ZS 256 formats): GMX 640×200 imports at native 640×200 resolution, preserving fine detail (thin text, single-pixel lines) from high-resolution sources. All dithering methods are supported. GMX 160×200 is attribute-only (fixed bitmap pattern) — dithering is not applicable.

### Select Dithering Algorithm

In the **Transform** section, choose a dithering method. Default is **None** (nearest color). Recommended dithering options:
- **Cell Floyd** — good general-purpose cell-aware dithering
- **Cell Atkinson** — lighter dithering, retains more detail
- **Cell Ordered** — structured pattern dithering
- **Floyd-Steinberg** — classic error diffusion
- **Dizzy** — error diffusion with blue-noise-like output (no edge artifacts)
- **a-dither** — fast hash-based threshold dither, spatially stable

Below the dither dropdown:
- **Strength** (0–100%) scales error diffusion intensity; on ordered / pattern / blue-noise / a-dither methods, Strength > 0 engages a hybrid ordered+diffusion mode
- **Serpentine scan** alternates row direction during error diffusion to reduce horizontal banding
- **Pre-blur** (0–50) blurs cell pixels before choosing the ink/paper color pair. Useful for noisy or highly detailed images where attribute clash is severe. The bitmap detail stays sharp — only the color decision is affected

In the **Source** section:
- **Colors** dropdown selects the color space for matching: RGB, LAB, or OkLab (default). OkLab generally produces the best results, especially for blues and purples
- **Pair fit** dropdown selects the strategy for choosing the ink/paper color pair per cell: Best fit (exhaustive nearest-color), Blend fit (line-projection metric that models dithering blend quality), or PCA gradient (PCA-guided candidates with line-projection). Try Blend fit or PCA gradient for smoother color transitions

In the **Output** section:
- The **palette strip** below the Palette dropdown lets you click individual colors to disable them. Disabled colors won't be used during conversion. This is useful for restricting the output to a specific subset of ZX colors (e.g., disable bright colors to force all-regular output)

### Set Paper Color Rule

The **Paper** dropdown controls how ink and paper colors are assigned per cell (not applied to ULA+ format):
- **Darker color** — default; darker color becomes paper in each cell. For single-color cells, dark colors become paper (0 bits), light colors become ink (1 bits)
- **Lighter color** — lighter color becomes paper in each cell. For single-color cells, light colors become paper (0 bits), dark colors become ink (1 bits)
- **First pixel paper** — the top-left pixel's color in each cell becomes paper (useful for spritesheets where a frame pixel marks the background color)

### Adjust Crop and Fit

In the **Source** section:
- Adjust **X, Y, W, H** to crop the source image
- Click **Detect** to auto-find a 256×192 region
- Enable **4:3** to lock the aspect ratio

In the **Transform** section:
- **Stretch** — stretch to fill (may distort)
- **Letterbox** — fit within target, add black bars
- **Fill/crop** — fill target, crop excess
- **Fit width** / **Fit height** — fit to one dimension

### Fine-Tune with Adjustments

Click the **Adjustments** tab to access:
- Contrast, Brightness, Saturation
- Gamma, Sharpness, Smoothing
- Levels (black/white point)
- Color balance (R, G, B)

All adjustments update the preview in real time. Click the **Reset** button (bottom-right of the panel) to reset all adjustment controls to their default values.

### Tile to Screens

To split a large image into a grid of ZX Spectrum pictures:

1. In the **Output** section, check **Tile to screens**
2. The info line shows the grid size (e.g. 3×4 = 12 pictures)
3. Yellow dashed lines on the original canvas show tile boundaries
4. Use the ◄/► buttons to navigate between tiles — the preview shows the actual converted output for each tile, and the current tile is highlighted on the original canvas
5. Click **Import** — each tile is added as a separate picture tab
6. Edge tiles (last column/row) are padded with black if the source doesn't divide evenly

Position, Size, Fit mode, and Align controls are disabled during tiling since each tile's placement is calculated automatically.

### Apply

Click **Import** to apply the conversion and load the result as an editable picture.

![Importing an image](screenshots/tutorial_import.png)

### Compare Settings with A/B

Not sure which dithering or color strategy looks best? Use the A/B comparison to try two sets of settings side by side:

1. Set up your preferred settings — these become slot **A**
2. Click **B** in the Compare group (right side of the tab bar) to switch to slot B
3. Change settings (e.g. switch dithering to Floyd-Steinberg, try a different color strategy)
4. Click **A+B** to see both results side by side — click a panel to switch which slot you're editing
5. Use **Copy A→B** to duplicate settings from one slot to the other as a starting point
6. When satisfied, make sure the preferred slot is active and click **Import**

Auto-labels below each preview show a concise summary of each slot's settings for quick reference.

## 12. Working with Sprites

A **spriteset** is a named entry in the sprite list that holds one or more individual **sprites** (animation frames). Each spriteset has fixed dimensions (W × H) and a color mode.

### Create a Spriteset

1. Switch to the **Sprites** tab
2. Click **+ Add** to create a new spriteset
3. Set the spriteset properties:
   - **Name** — give it a descriptive name
   - **W / H** — dimensions in 8×8 cells (e.g., 2×2 = 16×16 pixels); these become locked once you draw content (clear all sprites to unlock)
   - **Mode** — Mono (1-bit), Attributed (with colors), or Multicolour (8×1 / 8×2 / 8×4 attribute cell height); locked after drawing

### Open the Sprite Editor

Click **Edit** (in the toolbar between Add and Delete) to open the floating Sprite Editor panel.

### Draw Sprite Pixels

In the Sprite Editor:
- Use the **Draw** tool (D) to set pixels — left click draws ink (sets bits), right click draws paper (clears bits)
- Use the **Erase** tool (E) to clear pixels — left click erases, right click sets
- Use **Fill** (F) — left click fills with ink, right click fills with paper
- Use **Line** (L) or **Rectangle** (R) for shapes — left click = ink, right click = paper
- For Attributed mode, select colors from the two-row color palette (top = normal, bottom = bright). Left-click sets ink, right-click sets paper. Clicking either row moves both ink and paper to that brightness. The palette colors match the Palette selection on the View tab — switch palettes there to see updated colors in the sprite editor

### Add Animation Sprites

1. Click **+** to add a new sprite (animation frame) to the current spriteset
2. Click **Dup** to duplicate the current sprite
3. Use **< / >** to navigate between sprites
4. Click **Play** to preview the animation
5. Adjust **Speed** slider for animation timing
6. Use the **frame bar** below the preview to click-select sprites
7. **Ctrl+Click** sprites to multi-select, **Shift+Click** for range select
8. Use **◄ / ►** to reorder selected sprites
9. **Del** removes all selected sprites (at least one sprite is always kept)

### Grab Sprites from Screen

1. Make sure you have a picture loaded on the main canvas
2. Set **W / H** and **Mode** in the Spriteset Properties section — these values are used for grab cell size and color mode
3. Click the **Grab** button in the Sprites tab
4. Select the grab mode (Single sprite, Sprite phases, etc.)
5. Drag a rectangle on the canvas to capture sprites — each grab creates a **new spriteset**
6. Press **Escape** or click **Stop** when done

### Multi-Select and Batch Operations

You can select multiple spritesets for batch operations:

1. **Ctrl+Click** spritesets to add/remove them from the selection
2. **Shift+Click** to select a contiguous range
3. **Right-click** on the sprite list to open the context menu:
   - **Merge selected to animation** — combine selected spritesets into one multi-sprite spriteset (must have the same dimensions and mode)
   - **Add frames to…** — copy sprites from selected spritesets to another spriteset
   - **Move frames to…** — move sprites to another spriteset, removing the source spritesets
   - **Split frames to sprites** — break a multi-sprite spriteset into individual single-sprite spritesets
   - **Delete selected** — remove all selected spritesets
   - **Clear all** — remove all spritesets (with confirmation)

### Export Sprites

- **Export ASM** — generate Z80 assembly code for sprite data
- **Export BIN** — export raw binary data
- **Use as Brush** — use the selected sprite as a drawing brush on the main canvas

![Sprite editing](screenshots/tutorial_sprites.png)

## 13. Working with ULA+ Format

### Create or Open a ULA+ Picture

1. Click **New** → select **ULA+ (.scr)** → **Create**
2. Or open an existing ULA+ `.scr` file (6976 bytes)

### Understanding ULA+ Colors

ULA+ provides **64 programmable colors** organized in 4 CLUTs (Color Look-Up Tables):
- Each CLUT has 8 ink + 8 paper colors
- Colors are encoded in GRB332 format (3-bit green, 3-bit red, 2-bit blue)
- Ink and paper must come from the same CLUT

### Switch CLUT Banks

In Classic mode, click the CLUT buttons (**0, 1, 2, 3**) to switch between banks:
- CLUT 0: FLASH=0 BRIGHT=0
- CLUT 1: FLASH=0 BRIGHT=1
- CLUT 2: FLASH=1 BRIGHT=0
- CLUT 3: FLASH=1 BRIGHT=1

Toggle between **Grid** mode (all 64 colors) and **Classic** mode with the checkbox.

### Edit Individual Colors

**Ctrl+click** on any palette color to open the color editor:
- Adjust **R** (0-7), **G** (0-7), **B** (0-3) sliders
- See the Original and New color side by side
- Click **Apply** to set the new color

### Copy and Swap Colors

**Shift+click** on any palette color to mark it as the copy source (animated border appears):
- **Click** another color to copy the source's GRB value to it
- **Shift+click** another color to swap both GRB values
- **Click the same cell** or press **Escape** to cancel
- All copy/swap operations support undo (Ctrl+Z)

### Save and Load Palettes

- Click 💾 to save the palette as a `.pal` file
- Click 📂 to load a `.pal` file

![ULA+ editing](screenshots/tutorial_ulaplus.png)

### Viewing ULANext Files (ZX Spectrum Next)

ULANext is an extended palette mode for the ZX Spectrum Next. Unlike ULA+ (which uses 4 CLUTs of 16 fixed-assignment colors), ULANext uses a configurable **ink mask** to split each attribute byte into ink and paper palette indices. This allows much larger palettes — up to 256 ink or 256 paper colors.

1. Open a `.scr` file with ULANext palette (file size 6945–7426 bytes)
2. SpectraLab auto-detects the ink mask and palette from the file
3. The format info panel shows:
   - The ink mask value (e.g., $0F for 16 ink / 16 paper)
   - The number of ink and paper colors
   - Whether the palette uses 8-bit or 9-bit color entries
4. Drawing tools work as usual — the bitmap and attributes are standard SCR format
5. Flash is not available (attribute bits 6-7 are used for palette indexing)
6. Saving preserves the original ink mask and palette

**Valid ink masks and their ink/paper splits:**

| Mask | Ink colors | Paper colors |
|------|-----------|--------------|
| $01  | 2         | 128          |
| $03  | 4         | 64           |
| $07  | 8         | 32           |
| $0F  | 16        | 16           |
| $1F  | 32        | 8            |
| $3F  | 64        | 4            |
| $7F  | 128       | 2            |
| $FF  | 256       | 1            |

### Editing Next Palette Colors (NXI / SL2 / LoRes)

When editing NXI, SL2, LoRes, or LoRes Radastan files, the palette grid supports color editing:

**Ctrl+click** on any palette color to open the color editor:
- Adjust **R** (0-7), **G** (0-7), **B** (0-7) sliders (RGB333 — 512 possible colors)
- See the Original and New color side by side
- The palette index and RGB333 value are displayed
- Click **Apply** to set the new color

**Shift+click** on any palette color to mark it as the copy source (animated border appears):
- **Click** another color to copy the source color to it
- **Shift+click** another color to swap both colors (pixels are remapped automatically)
- **Click the same cell** or press **Escape** to cancel
- All operations support undo (Ctrl+Z)

> **Note:** NXI files embed the palette in the file header — palette edits are always saved. SL2 files with a non-default palette automatically embed the palette after the pixel data on save; files with the default RGB332 palette are saved as raw pixels only. LoRes and Radastan files without an embedded palette do not store the palette — if you edit colors, a warning will appear on save. Radastan files loaded with an embedded palette (6160 or 6176 bytes) will preserve palette changes.

## 14. Working with Multicolor Formats (IFL/MLT)

### Create an IFL or MLT Picture

1. Click **New**
2. Select **IFL (.ifl)** for 8×2 multicolor or **MLT (.mlt)** for 8×1 multicolor
3. Click **Create**

### Understanding Multicolor

Standard ZX Spectrum screens have 8×8 pixel attribute cells. Multicolor formats reduce the cell height:
- **IFL (8×2)** — each 8×2 pixel area can have its own ink/paper colors
- **MLT (8×1)** — each 8×1 pixel row can have its own ink/paper colors

This allows significantly more color detail at the cost of a larger file.

### Drawing

Drawing works the same as standard SCR — select ink/paper colors, use drawing tools. The difference is visible in the attribute grid (use **G** to cycle grid sizes) and in the number of available colors per area.

![Multicolor editing](screenshots/tutorial_multicolor.png)

## 15. Working with Gigascreen

### Create a Gigascreen Picture

1. Click **New** → select **Gigascreen (.img)** → **Create**

### Understanding Gigascreen

Gigascreen works by alternating two standard SCR frames at ~50Hz. The eye perceives the average of both frames, effectively doubling the available colors. Where a standard screen has 15 colors, Gigascreen can display many more virtual colors.

### Editing Both Frames (Combined Mode)

The Gigascreen palette shows all virtual colors as a 16-column grid:
- Left-click to select ink
- Right-click to select paper
- The **Cell Colors** section shows the 4 available colors for the current cell

### Split-Screen Editing (Screen 1 / Screen 2)

For finer control, switch to per-frame editing using the mode selector in the editor sidebar:

1. Press **Alt+1** or **Alt+2** (or click **Screen 1** / **Screen 2**) to edit a single frame
2. The main canvas shows only that frame as a standard SCR with the normal 16-color palette
3. Use ink, paper, bright, and flash controls as with any standard SCR
4. The floating preview always shows the blended Gigascreen result — watch it update as you draw
5. Press **Alt+3** (or click **Gigascreen**) to return to combined mode with the 136-color virtual palette

This is useful when you need to:
- Set different bright/flash attributes on each frame independently
- Fine-tune individual frame details that are hard to control in combined mode
- Use standard SCR editing techniques on one frame at a time

### Preview with Blending

In the View tab, select the Gigascreen display mode:
- **Blend dark** — shows the perceived image as it appears on a real CRT, with darkening from vertical retrace blanking
- **Blend** — shows the blended image at full brightness
- **Emulate flicker** — alternates between frames to simulate real hardware

### Gigascreen Variants: HLR and STL

Two additional gigascreen-based formats offer low-resolution modes with large "fat" pixels:

**HLR (High Lores)** — 32×24 fat pixels (each 8×8 real pixels):
1. Click **New** → select **HLR (.hlr)** → **Create**
2. Each fat pixel is a full 8×8 attribute cell, using the gigascreen palette to blend two frames
3. A user-editable 8-byte fill pattern determines how ink and paper contribute to the perceived color
4. File size: 1536 bytes (two interleaved 768-byte attribute frames)

**STL (Stellar)** — 64×48 fat pixels (each 4×4 real pixels):
1. Click **New** → select **STL (.stl)** → **Create**
2. Uses multicolor attributes (8×4 cell height) with gigascreen blending
3. A fixed bitmap pattern splits each 8-pixel column into left half (paper) and right half (ink)
4. File size: 3072 bytes (two interleaved 1536-byte attribute frames)

Both formats use the same gigascreen palette and Blend dark/Blend/Emulate flicker display modes. Drawing tools (pencil, fill, color picker) work on the fat-pixel level. Only pure ink+ink and paper+paper virtual colors are available per cell half.

### Gigaattr: Shared Bitmap Variant

**Gigaattr (.ga)** is a compact gigascreen variant where both frames share a single bitmap but have independent attributes:

1. Click **New** → select **Gigaattr (.ga)** → **Create**
2. File size: 7680 bytes (6144 bitmap + 768 attrs frame 1 + 768 attrs frame 2)
3. Each pixel is either SET or CLEAR in both frames simultaneously — giving 2 blended colors per cell (blend of two inks for SET pixels, blend of two papers for CLEAR pixels)
4. Uses the same gigascreen palette and Blend dark/Blend/Emulate flicker display modes
5. Editing and importing work the same way as standard Gigascreen
6. **Image import**: select **Gigaattr** in the Format dropdown of the Image Import dialog — uses the same shared-bitmap + two-attribute-frame algorithm, optimizing blended color pairs from the 136-color Gigascreen palette

The key difference from Gigascreen (.img): standard Gigascreen has independent bitmaps per frame (4 colors per cell), while Gigaattr has a shared bitmap (2 colors per cell) but half the file size. ASM export produces a minimal 48K-compatible viewer using LDIR.

### GA/GAP Pattern Mode: Compact Pattern-Based Variants

GA and GAP also support a **pattern mode** — instead of a full 6144-byte bitmap, the file stores an 8-byte fill pattern tile (same concept as HLR). The pattern is replicated across all 32×24 cells, dividing each cell into ink and paper regions.

**Creating a pattern picture:**
1. Click **New** → select **GA Pattern (.ga)**, **GAP Pattern (.gap)**, or **GAP Dual Pattern (.gap)** → a settings dialog opens with a fill pattern grid and border color selectors → **Create**
2. Or convert an existing .53c file via Xform → Convert → "GA (Gigaattr pattern)" / "GAP (Gigaattr+ULA+ pattern, shared)" / "GAP (Gigaattr+ULA+ dual pattern)"

**File sizes:** GA pattern = 1546 bytes, GAP shared pattern = 1610 bytes, GAP dual pattern = 1674 bytes.

**Editing:** Drawing tools in pattern mode modify only attributes (ink/paper colors). The bitmap pattern is fixed and cannot be changed by pixel tools. This is the same editing model as HLR.

**Image import:** Select "GA Pattern", "GAP Pattern", or "GAP Dual Pattern" in the Format dropdown — a fill pattern selector appears to choose the pattern tile.

### Gigaattr+ULA+ (GAP): 64-Color Palette Variant

**Gigaattr+ULA+ (.gap)** extends Gigaattr with a ULA+ 64-color palette, replacing the standard 16 ZX colors:

1. Click **New** → select **Gigaattr+ULA+ (.gap)** → **Create**, or convert an existing GA via Xform → Convert → "→ GAP (add ULA+ palette)"
2. File size: 7744 bytes (shared palette) or 7808 bytes (dual palette)
3. In Screen 1 / Screen 2 mode, the ULA+ palette grid appears below the edit mode buttons — click any color to edit it with the RGB sliders
4. **Shared palette** (default): both frames use the same 64-color palette
5. **Dual palette**: each frame has its own independent 64-color palette — switch via Xform → Convert → "→ GAP dual palette (separate palette per frame)". Edit Screen 1's palette and Screen 2's palette independently by switching edit modes
6. In Gigascreen mode with dual palettes, the 1024-entry ink and paper grids are split into 4 CLUT pages (256 entries each). Use the **CLUT page** buttons (0–3) above the palette grid to switch pages. Each page shows 8 frame 1 inks from one CLUT × all 32 frame 2 colors
7. Convert back via "→ GAP shared palette (discard palette 2)" — palette 2 is discarded, palette 1 is kept
8. The View tab shows "(shared palette)" or "(dual palette)" in the format info
9. **Image import**: select **GAP** in the Format dropdown of the Image Import dialog — uses the same conversion algorithm as Gigaattr (shared bitmap, two attribute frames, 136 blended colors) and appends a default ULA+ palette matching standard ZX colors. The palette can be edited after import via the ULA+ palette grid
10. **GAP Dual import**: select **GAP Dual** in the Format dropdown to generate two independent 64-color ULA+ palettes — one per frame — giving richer color blends. Palette 1 covers the most frequent colors; palette 2 is a complement palette emphasizing colors that palette 1 missed. Output is a 7808-byte .gap file with 128-byte dual palette. In the editor, the ink and paper grids have independent selection — click the ink grid for ink, click the paper strip for paper

## 16. Working with Scorpion GMX Formats

### Overview

The Scorpion ZS 256 Turbo computer features two extended graphics modes beyond the standard ZX Spectrum screen. Both use 8×1 attribute cells (one attribute per pixel row) with standard ZX Spectrum colors. The display preserves all 640 horizontal pixels and doubles each row vertically (640×400 on screen) to maintain the correct aspect ratio.

### GMX 640×200 (Hi-Res)

1. Open a `.c` file of 32768 bytes, or create a new one via **New** → **GMX 640×200 (.c)**
2. The screen is 640×200 pixels with 80 attribute columns and 200 attribute rows
3. Drawing works the same as standard SCR — pixel and attribute editing, all drawing tools (pencil, line, rectangle, circle, fill, text, brushes), layers, and undo/redo
4. The attribute grid shows 8×1 cells (press **G** to toggle grid visibility)
5. Save with **Ctrl+S** — exports as 32768-byte `.c` file

### GMX 160×200 (Attribute-Only)

1. Open a `.c` file of 16128 bytes (with "GMX\x0F" header)
2. The screen is 160×200 color cells (80 attribute columns × 200 rows, each cell 8 pixels wide × 1 pixel tall)
3. This is an **attribute-only** format — there is no bitmap to edit. Drawing tools recolor cells using the current ink/paper/bright settings
4. Use the **Recolor** tool or any drawing tool to paint attribute cells
5. **Flood fill** works on the attribute cell grid (fills contiguous cells with the same attribute)
6. Save with **Ctrl+S** — exports as 16128-byte `.c` file with the "GMX\x0F" header

### Tips

- Both formats display with doubled rows (640×400 on screen) to preserve all horizontal pixel detail. The grid and all preview overlays account for this automatically.
- The color picker (**I** key) reads the attribute under the cursor for both formats.
- Layers are supported for both formats.

## 17. Combining Screens into One Picture

Several `.scr` screens can be joined into one larger **chr$** image — a 512×192 panorama from two screens, a 512×384 sheet from four, and so on. Character cells are copied byte for byte, so nothing is re-dithered or re-colored: the result looks exactly like the originals placed side by side.

### Combining two screens

1. Click the file input and select **two `.scr` files** at once (Ctrl+click or Shift+click in the file dialog). Dragging both onto the window works too
2. SpectraLab asks what to do with them — click **Combine…**
3. The Combine dialog opens with both files listed and ticked
4. Set **Pictures per row**:
   - `2` — side by side, giving **512×192**
   - `1` — stacked, giving **256×384**
5. Check the preview, then click **Combine**

The result opens as a new `combined.ch$` tab and the two source screens are closed, leaving only the joined picture. Press **Ctrl+S** to save it.

### Choosing which screen goes where

The order of the list is the layout order — slots fill left to right, then top to bottom. Use the **▲▼** buttons on a row to move a screen.

With four screens at 2 per row, the list order maps to the grid like this:

```
list: A B C D        A  B
                     C  D
```

Move `C` up twice and you get:

```
list: C A B D        C  A
                     B  D
```

### Combining pictures that are already open

If the screens are already open as tabs — because you loaded them one at a time, or just finished editing one — use **Tools tab → Pictures → Combine…** instead. It is the same dialog, listing everything currently open.

Untick a picture to leave it out. Untick **Close source pictures** if you want to keep the originals open alongside the result.

### Filling the leftovers

If the number of screens does not fill the grid — five pictures at 2 per row leaves one empty slot — the spare cells are painted with the **Fill empty cells** colors. They show as a checkerboard in the preview and are counted on the output line, so you can see what will be filled before committing.

### When a screen cannot be combined

Only plain `.scr` can be joined. Other open pictures still appear in the list, greyed out with the reason:

- `not a plain .scr (bsc)` — a different format
- `has a ULA+ palette` — chr$ has nowhere to store a palette
- `4-line attributes` — chr$ stores one attribute per 8×8 cell only

Convert those first (**Xform** tab → *Convert to…* → SCR), then combine.

---

## 18. Saving and Exporting

### Save in Native Format

Press **Ctrl+S** or click the **Save** button. The file is downloaded in its original format.

For **SPECSCII**, the editor sidebar has a **Save INVERSE codes** checkbox. Leave it **off** (the default) for maximum compatibility — inverted cells are baked in by swapping ink/paper, which looks identical and avoids the black screen some viewers (e.g. ZXArt) show when they hit the `INVERSE` control code. Turn it **on** only if you need the actual `INVERSE` codes preserved in the stream.

### Convert Between Formats

1. Go to the **Xform** tab
2. Use the **Convert to...** dropdown
3. Select the target format — the picture is converted in place

Conversions include lossless transformations (e.g. NXI ↔ SL2 moves the palette between header and tail, GA ↔ GAP adds/strips ULA+ palette) and lossy ones (e.g. SCR → NXI 320×256 renders and upscales the image, NXI/SL2 → SCR downscales and quantizes to ZX attributes). When converting NXI → SL2 with a custom palette, a dialog offers three options: keep palette (embed in SL2), quantize to default RGB332 (lossy), or strip palette (keep pixel indices unchanged). Cross-mode NXI/SL2 conversions between 256×192, 320×256, and 640×256 are also available. SCR → SPECSCII conversion matches each 8×8 cell bitmap to the best ROM font character or block graphic, preserving attributes. GAP format also supports in-format palette toggle: shared → dual palette (duplicates palette 1 for independent per-frame editing) and dual → shared (discards palette 2).

### Optimize Attributes (SCR)

Pictures converted from other software sometimes have suboptimal ink/paper assignments — for example, paper is darker than ink in some cells. This doesn't affect the displayed colors, but makes the monochrome bitmap look worse and compresses poorly.

1. Load an SCR file (or import an image as SCR)
2. Go to the **Xform** tab → **Optimize Attributes** section
3. Choose a mode:
   - **Paper = lighter color** — ensures paper is always the brighter color (most natural look)
   - **Paper = majority pixels** — ensures paper covers more area than ink
   - **Combined** — applies both brightness and majority rules
   - **Minimize ink bits** — minimizes set bits for best compression
4. Click **Apply** — the info label shows how many cells were flipped
5. Undo with Ctrl+Z if needed

### Clean Hidden Cells

When ink equals paper in a cell, any bitmap pattern is invisible — but the non-uniform bytes remain in the file, wasting space and hurting compression. The "Clean Hidden Cells" tool fixes this automatically.

1. Load a file in any supported format (SCR, BSC, IFL, MLT, BMC4, GMX, Gigascreen, ULA+)
2. Go to the **Xform** tab → **Clean Hidden Cells** section
3. Click **Apply** — each hidden cell's bitmap is set to 0x00 or 0xFF based on what the surrounding cells look like (neighbor bitmap density)
4. The info label shows how many cells were cleaned
5. Undo with Ctrl+Z if needed

Check the File Info panel — the "Hidden cells" counter should drop to zero after cleaning.

### Export to Other Formats

1. In the **Xform** tab, select an export format from the dropdown
2. Optionally check **Embed** to embed data
3. Click **Export**

### Export to PNG / GIF

Use the **PNG/GIF** button in the Xform tab to export the current screen as a standard image file.

- The exported image uses all your current View tab settings — zoom, border size and color, grid/subgrid overlays, palette, and display filters — so what you see is what you get.
- For **gigascreen-family formats** (Gigascreen, MGH, HLR, STL, BSP-gigascreen, chr$-gigascreen), a dialog asks you to choose:
  - **Blended (PNG)** — averaged/blended colors in a single image
  - **Flicker (animated GIF)** — two alternating frames at ~50fps, just like real hardware
- For **pictures with flash attributes**, a dialog asks you to choose:
  - **Animated GIF** — two-frame flash animation (320ms per phase), matching ZX Spectrum timing
  - **Static PNG** — normal phase only, no animation
- For all other formats, clicking the button opens a confirmation dialog and exports a PNG directly.

### RCS Export (SCR only)

[RCS (Re-ordered Compressed Screen)](https://github.com/einar-saukas/RCS) by Einar Saukas rearranges SCR bitmap bytes for better compression. To export:

1. Load an SCR file
2. In the **Xform** tab, select `.rcs (RCS reordered)` from the **Export** dropdown
3. Click **Export** — downloads a 6912-byte `.rcs` file
4. Compress the `.rcs` file with ZX7 or another packer for optimal results

The reordering groups spatially related bytes together (sector → column → character row → pixel line), which typically yields significantly smaller compressed output than packing the standard SCR layout directly.

You can also open `.rcs` files directly in SpectraLab — the RCS reordering is automatically reversed on load, converting the data back to standard SCR for viewing and editing.

### ZX7 / ZX0 Compression (SCR only)

SpectraLab includes built-in [ZX7](https://spectrumcomputing.co.uk/entry/27996/ZX-Spectrum/ZX7) and [ZX0](https://github.com/einar-saukas/ZX0) (v2 format) compression by Einar Saukas, plus several other compressors. For SCR files, the Export dropdown offers:

**Direct export:**

1. Select a compressed format — `.scr.zx7`, `.scr.zx0`, `.rcs.zx7`, `.rcs.zx0`, `.scr.lgk`, `.scr.asc` (ASC v2.9), `.scr.lc`, `.scr.lzf`, `.scr.rle`, `.scr.upk`, `.scr.c4` (Chunks 4×4), `.scr.c2` (Chunks 4×2)
2. Click **Export** — downloads the compressed file
3. Note: Chunks formats (`.scr.c4`, `.scr.c2`) are **lossy monochrome** — they produce fixed-size output by encoding bitmap blocks as 2-bit indices into a 4-pattern dictionary. Attributes are not stored.

**Compare all variants:**

1. Select `Compare compressions...` from the Export dropdown
2. Click **Compare** — a dialog shows compression variants side-by-side (enable/disable formats via ⚙ settings)
3. The best (smallest) result is highlighted and pre-selected
4. Select the variant you want and click **Save**
5. Optional: check **Create ASM** before saving to also generate a sjasmplus `.asm` file that decompresses the data directly to screen memory (`device zxspectrum48`, `savesna`)

**Opening compressed files:**

Open `.scr.zx7`/`.scr.zx7b`/`.scr.zx0`/`.scr.zx0b`, `.rcs.zx7`/`.rcs.zx7b`/`.rcs.zx0`/`.rcs.zx0b`, `.scr.lgk`, or `.scr.asc` files directly — SpectraLab automatically decompresses the data (forward or backward) and reverses RCS reordering if needed.

### Format ASM Export

SpectraLab can generate complete viewer programs as sjasmplus ASM source for several formats. The Export dropdown in the Xform tab shows available options based on the loaded format:

1. Load a picture in a supported format (BSC, Gigascreen, MGH, RGB3, IFL, ULA+, NXI, or SL2)
2. In the **Xform** tab, the **Export** dropdown appears with the ASM option (e.g. "ASM (Next Layer 2 .nex)")
3. Optionally toggle **Embed** — checked embeds pixel data as DB lines, unchecked uses INCBIN references to the original file
4. Click **Export** to download the .asm file
5. Assemble with sjasmplus to produce a .sna (Pentagon) or .nex (Next) file ready to run in an emulator or on real hardware

Supported formats: BSC (border effects), Gigascreen/MGH (dual-screen), Gigaattr (48K attr flicker), Gigaattr+ULA+ (48K ULA+ attr flicker), RGB3 (RGB flicker), IFL (8×2 multicolor), ULA+ (64-color palette), and NXI/SL2 (Next Layer 2 in all modes: 256×192, 320×256, 640×256).

### ASM Code Export

For game developers who need sprite/screen data as Z80 assembly:

1. Select an area using the **Select** tool (S)
2. In the Xform tab, the **Export Selection to ASM** section appears
3. Configure options:
   - **Include attributes** — include color data
   - **Attribute mode** — after bitmap or interleaved
   - **Line mode** — line-based or block-based DEFB statements
   - **Direction** — left-to-right, right-to-left, or zigzag
   - **Visual comments** — add █· block art comments
4. Click **Save ASM file** or **Copy** to clipboard

## 19. Working with SCA Animations

### Open an SCA File

Load a `.sca` file. The animation controls appear below the main tabs.

### Import Animated GIF

When you open a multi-frame animated GIF, the standard Image Import dialog opens. A **mode dropdown** appears next to the Import button:

1. Open an animated GIF file (via Open or drag-and-drop)
2. The import dialog opens with dithering/format/adjustment controls as usual
3. Use the **◄/► buttons** or **slider** next to the mode dropdown to browse individual frames — the preview updates to show each frame with the current format, dithering, and adjustments
4. Select the import mode from the dropdown:
   - **Picture** — import the currently previewed frame as a static picture using the selected format and settings
   - **Flash** (2-frame GIFs only) — convert both frames into a single SCR with FLASH attributes. Cells that differ between the two frames use the FLASH bit to alternate ink↔paper every 320ms; identical cells remain static
   - **Animation** — convert all frames to an SCA animation. Per-frame delays from the GIF are preserved. After import, the full SCA editor is available (filmstrip, playback, trim, delay editing, optimize, export). The output type depends on the **Format** dropdown:
     - **53c** → SCA type 1 (attribute-only frames with fill pattern) — select the desired pattern from the **53c Pattern** dropdown (Checker, Stripes, DD/77, or Custom with hex input)
     - **Chunks 4×4** or **Chunks 4×2** → SCA type 2 (chunks-compressed monochrome frames). Encoded size depends on the selected region — e.g. 768 bytes per frame for 4×4 full screen, or 256 bytes for a single third
     - Any other format → SCA type 0 (full SCR frames, 6912 bytes per frame)
5. Click **Import** to apply

### Navigate Frames

- Click **<** / **>** to step through frames
- Use the **frame slider** to scrub
- Press **Space** to play/pause
- Press **Left/Right** arrow keys for frame-by-frame navigation

### Edit an SCA Animation

The SCA editor opens as a fullscreen overlay. Here you can:

1. **Trim frames** — remove frames from the start or end
2. **Adjust delays** — set frame timing, apply to current or all frames
3. **Optimize** — remove consecutive duplicate frames
4. **Preview** — play the animation with live preview

### Save and Export

- **Save As...** — dropdown with export options:
  - **SCA** — save as SCA animation. The save settings window offers compression for type 2: Uncompressed, ZX0, Laser Compact, or RLE. RLE offers the fastest Z80 decompression with moderate compression ratio. Chunks 4×4/4×2 animations use their own compression and don't need additional settings. ASM export is also available from the settings window — supports all types including chunks (with embedded lookup table and Z80 depacker)
  - **SCR zip** — export all frames as SCR files in a ZIP
  - **53c zip** — export all frames as 53c attribute files in a ZIP
  - **GIF** — export as animated GIF with per-frame delay
  - **PNG zip** — export as numbered PNG images in a ZIP

## 20. Using Reference Images

### Load a Reference Image

1. In the **View** tab, expand the **Reference Image** section
2. Click **Load** and select any image file
3. The reference image appears behind the canvas at reduced opacity

### Adjust the Reference

- **Opacity** slider — control transparency (5% to 80%)
- **X / Y** — position the reference relative to the canvas
- **W / H** — resize the reference (leave empty for auto-fit)
- **Show** checkbox — toggle visibility

### Draw Over the Reference

Switch to the **Edit** tab and draw normally. The reference image shows through the canvas, helping you trace or match proportions. This is especially useful when converting real-world images to ZX Spectrum format.

### Clear the Reference

Click **Clear** to remove the reference image.

> **Tip:** Reference images are preserved in workspace files (.slw).

![Reference image](screenshots/tutorial_reference.png)

## 21. Editing Fonts

The Font Editor lets you create and modify ZX Spectrum bitmap fonts — both fixed-width 8×8 fonts and FZX proportional fonts. Supports up to 1024 glyphs in a single unified buffer.

### Opening the Font Editor

1. In the View tab, find the bottom bar with "SpectraLab" and click the **Font** link
2. The Font Editor opens in a new browser tab
3. The ZX Spectrum ROM font (96 glyphs) is loaded by default

### Creating a New Font

1. Click the **New ▾** dropdown in the header
2. Choose from: 96 glyphs, 256 glyphs, custom glyph count (up to 1024), exploded (256 interlaced), or new FZX font

### Loading an Existing Font

1. Click **Load** in the header
2. Browse to a font file (`.768`, `.ch8`, `.bin`, `.SpecCHR`, `.fnt`, or `.fzx`)
3. The editor auto-detects the glyph count from the file size
4. For 2048-byte files, a visual chooser shows both normal and interlaced interpretations side by side — click the one that looks correct

### Editing Glyph Pixels

1. Click a glyph in the left grid to select it (or use **arrow keys** to navigate)
2. The glyph appears zoomed in the center panel (50× zoom for 8×8, dynamic for FZX)
3. Choose a drawing tool from the **Tools** row (or press **P** / **L** / **R** / **O** / **E**):
   - **Pixel** (P) — click/drag to toggle pixels (left click = XOR toggle, right click = clear)
   - **Line** (L) — drag to preview a line, release to draw (left = set, right = clear)
   - **Rectangle** (R) — drag to preview, release to draw (left = outline, right = filled)
   - **Circle** (O) — drag to preview, release to draw (left = outline, right = filled)
   - **Eraser** (E) — drag to erase pixels (left = freehand, right = erase rectangle area)
4. For shape tools, moving the mouse outside the canvas cancels the shape
5. Changes are reflected immediately in the grid
6. Check **Whole font** to apply pixel changes to all glyphs at once (respects per-glyph width in variable mode)
7. Use **Ctrl+C** to copy a glyph and **Ctrl+V** to paste (works across fixed/FZX modes)

### Applying Transforms

1. Select a glyph (or check **Whole font** for batch operation)
2. Use the **Scroll** arrows to shift pixels with wrap-around
3. Click **Invert** to flip all bits, or **Clear** to erase
4. Use the **Transform** dropdown for advanced operations: bold, italic, flip, rotate, and align (left/right/top/bottom)
5. Keyboard shortcuts: **B** = bold right, **I** = invert, **Delete** = clear
6. Use **Ctrl+Z** to undo any change, **Ctrl+Y** or **Ctrl+Shift+Z** to redo

### Managing Glyph Count

1. Use the **Glyphs** input (right of preview) to change the number of glyphs (1–1024)
2. Changing the count preserves existing glyph data and character mapping
3. Use the **Append** button to load a font file and add its glyphs after existing ones
4. This control works for both fixed-width and FZX fonts

### Converting Between Formats

1. Click the **→ FZX** button to convert a fixed-width font to FZX proportional format (calculates visual width per glyph and left-aligns the bitmap)
2. In FZX mode, click **→ Fixed** to convert back (clips to 8×8, applies shift offsets)

### Setting Up Character Mapping

1. Select a starting glyph in the grid
2. Type the characters to map in the **Characters** field (e.g., `ABCDEFGHIJ`)
3. Click **Map** — each character maps to consecutive glyphs
4. For Cyrillic fonts, use **From (Cyr) / To (Lat)** fields to remap lookalike characters

### Saving Your Font

1. Click **Save** — the editor automatically chooses the right action based on your font:
   - **96 glyphs** → saves `.768` directly (standard ZX Spectrum font)
   - **21 glyphs** → saves `.udg` directly
   - **256 glyphs** → a dialog asks Normal or Interlaced (pre-selects the current format)
   - **117 glyphs** (96+21) → choose between Single file, Font+UDG, or UDG+Font byte order
   - **>256 glyphs** → a range dialog lets you pick the first glyph and count to export
   - **Other counts** → saves `.bin` directly
   - **FZX fonts** → saves `.fzx` directly
2. Use **Export .metrics** to save character mappings as a JSON file
3. The `.metrics` file can be imported later to restore your mappings

> **Tip:** The Font Editor shares the same light/dark theme as SpectraLab. Toggle it in either window and the other picks it up on reload.

---

## 22. ZGS Scene Editor

The ZGS Editor lets you create and preview ZGS (ZX Graphics Script) vector scenes — a bytecode format used in ZX Spectrum adventure games for compact, resolution-independent graphics.

### Opening the ZGS Editor

1. In the Tools tab, click the **ZGS Editor** link
2. The editor opens in a new browser tab with a template scene
3. The preview canvas shows the rendered result immediately

### Creating a Scene from Scratch

1. Click **New** to start with a template
2. Edit the text in the left panel using ZGS assembly syntax:
   ```
   ; Set colors
   set_paper blue
   set_ink white bright
   clear_region 0, 0, 32, 24, 0x09

   ; Draw a house
   move_abs 30, 60
   rect_fill_abs 30, 60, 30, 25
   polygon_fill 30 60, 45 45, 60 60

   ; Done
   end
   ```
3. The preview auto-updates 500ms after you stop typing
4. Click **Render** to force an immediate re-render

### Working with ZGS Assembly

ZGS assembly uses logical coordinates (0–127 for X, 0–95 for Y) that map to screen pixels at 2x scale (256x192). Key instructions:

- **Colors:** `set_ink <color> [bright]`, `set_paper <color> [bright]`, `set_attr 0xNN`
  - Colors: `black`, `blue`, `red`, `magenta`, `green`, `cyan`, `yellow`, `white`
- **Patterns:** `set_pattern <name>` — `solid`, `empty`, `checker`, `dots25`, `dots12`, `horizontal`, `vertical`, `diagonal`
- **Draw mode:** `set_mode xor` (toggle pixels instead of setting), `set_mode set` (default — always set pixels)
- **Movement:** `move_abs x, y` (absolute), `move_short dx, dy` (small delta), `move_dmed dx, dy` (medium delta)
- **Lines:** `line_dmed dx, dy`, `hline_chain length`, `vline_abs x, y, length`
- **Shapes:** `rect_fill_abs x, y, w, h`, `circle_fill_abs cx, cy, r`, `polygon_fill x1 y1, x2 y2, ...`
- **Fill:** `flood_abs x, y` (flood fill from point), `flood_chain` (from current pen)
- **Regions:** `clear_region col, row, w, h, attr` (clear character cells)
- **Assets:** define reusable shape scripts (`.sub`/`.endsub`) and sprites (`.sprite`/`.endsprite`), invoke with `call N` or `stamp_abs N, x, y`
- **Text:** `set_cursor col, row` (set text cursor to character cell), `print_text "string"` (print ASCII text using ROM font), `print_packed "string"` (dictionary-compressed text, 30–50% smaller)
- **Loops:** `.repeat count, stride_x, stride_y` ... `.endrepeat`
- **Control:** `wait_key` (pause), `end` (halt)

### Adding Text to Scenes

ZGS supports printing text using the ZX Spectrum ROM font (8×8, characters 32–127). The text cursor uses character cell coordinates (col 0–31, row 0–23):

```
; Set colors for text
set_attr 0x47          ; white ink on black paper

; Place cursor and print
set_cursor 5, 10
print_text "Hello, Spectrum!"

; Print more text at a different position
set_ink yellow bright
set_cursor 5, 12
print_text "ZGS Text Demo"
```

The cursor advances after each character. When it reaches column 32, it wraps to the beginning of the next row. Text uses the current attribute for coloring.

### Mixing Text Modes (32-col, 42-col, 64-col)

ZGS supports three text widths for different density requirements. Each mode uses independent cursor tracking:

```
; Standard 32-column (8px wide)
set_cursor 0, 0
print_text "32-col: Standard width"

; 42-column (6px wide) for more text per line
set_cursor_42 0, 2
print_text_42 "42-col: Narrower characters, 42 per line"

; 64-column (4px wide) for maximum density
set_cursor_64 0, 4
print_text_64 "64-col: Very narrow, 64 chars/line, ideal for data tables"
```

Each text mode uses a separate font binary: `font_8x8.bin` (32-col), `font_6x8.bin` (42-col, top 6 bits of 8×8), `font_4x8.bin` (64-col, derived by OR-ing column pairs). You can replace any font binary with a custom design for each mode independently. Each mode has its own cursor position, so you can freely mix modes in one scene.

### Packed Text (Compressed)

For longer text passages (adventure game descriptions, dialogue), use `print_packed` to save space:

```
set_cursor 0, 0
print_packed "You are in a dark room. There is a door to the north."
```

`print_packed` looks identical to `print_text` when rendered, but the bytecode is 30–50% smaller for English text. It uses a dictionary of common bigrams (2-char pairs), trigrams (3-char sequences), and whole words. The `.dict` directive selects the dictionary:

```
.dict lower              ; lowercase English (default)
.dict upper              ; uppercase English
.dict user               ; custom dictionary loaded from .zdict file
```

To use a custom dictionary optimized for your game's text, select "Dict: user" from the dropdown and click "Load .zdict". You can generate custom dictionaries with `zgs_mkdict.py`:

```
python zgs_mkdict.py mytexts/*.zgt -o mygame.zdict
```

### Animated Playback

1. Click **Play** to watch the scene being drawn step by step (one opcode per tick)
2. Adjust the **Speed** slider to control animation speed (5ms = fast, 500ms = slow)
3. Click **Step** to execute a single opcode manually
4. Click **Pause** to stop the animation

### Using a Reference Image

You can load a reference image to trace or use as a drawing guide:

1. Click the **Reference Image** header below the playback controls to expand the panel
2. Click **Load** and select any image file (PNG, JPG, etc.)
3. The image appears semi-transparent over the preview canvas at 30% opacity
4. Adjust **Opacity** (5–80%), position (**X/Y**), and display size (**W/H**) as needed
5. Toggle **Show** to hide/reveal the reference without removing it
6. Click **Clear** to remove the reference image entirely

Each scene stores its own reference image. When you add a new scene, it inherits the current scene's reference image and settings. Reference images are saved in `.zgp` project files.

### Opening Existing Files

- Click **Open** to load a `.zgs` (binary) or `.zgt` (text) file
- Binary `.zgs` files are automatically disassembled to editable text
- Drag and drop a file onto the page to open it

### Saving Your Work

Click the **Save** button to open a dropdown menu with format choices:

- **Save .zgs** — assemble the text to binary ZGS format (reports errors if assembly fails)
- **Save .zgt** — save the text source as-is

### Error Handling

Assembler errors appear in the status bar with line numbers (e.g., "Line 15: Unknown mnemonic: rect_filll"). Fix the error and the preview updates automatically. The VM has a safety limit of 1M opcodes to prevent infinite loops.

## 23. Working with Plugins

Plugins let you extract and edit graphics from game snapshots or custom binary files, then save the edits back.

### Installing a Plugin

1. Open a `.slplugin` or `.slpluginjs` file through the main browse button, or drag-and-drop it onto the app
2. The plugin appears in the **Tools** tab → **Plugins** section and persists across sessions

Example plugins are in the `plugins/` folder.

### Extracting Pictures from a Snapshot (JSON Plugin)

This workflow lets you pull graphics from specific memory addresses in a .sna file:

1. Load `example.slplugin` (or write your own — see the `_doc` section inside the file for reference)
2. Click **Open…** next to the plugin name and select a `.sna` file
3. The plugin extracts pictures from the defined addresses and adds them to the picture tab bar
4. Edit the pictures normally — all drawing tools, layers, and transforms work. Use **Replace Picture…** to swap the active picture with a `.scr` file from disk
5. Click **Save Patched File** in the session bar to write the edits back into the snapshot and download it
6. Or click **Save Raw** to export each picture as a standalone file

### Using a Codec Plugin (JS Plugin)

Codec plugins handle compressed or encoded formats. For example, the RLE plugin:

1. Load `rle_scr.slpluginjs`
2. To **decode**: click **Open…** and select an RLE-compressed file — the decompressed screen appears in the editor
3. To **encode**: open any `.scr` picture the normal way, then click **Export** next to the plugin name — the picture is RLE-compressed and downloaded

### Editing Game Graphics in a Snapshot (JS Plugin with Session)

Some JS plugins extract multiple pictures from a game snapshot, let you edit them, and write everything back. The MARIA plugin is a real-world example:

1. Load `maria_sna.slpluginjs`
2. Click **Open…** and select the Maria's Christmas Box 48K `.sna` file
3. The plugin extracts 6 pictures: the loading screen (uncompressed at 0x4000) and 5 compressed game screens (auto-detects ZX0 vs RLE)
4. Edit any screen — all tools work normally. Or click **Replace Picture…** to quickly swap the current screen with a prepared `.scr` file from disk
5. Click **Save Patched File** — the plugin asks whether to use ZX0 (smaller) or RLE (original) compression. When ZX0 is chosen, bitmap data is reordered with RCS (Reverse Character Scan) before compression for better ratios. A progress window shows per-screen compression sizes with a progress bar and a Cancel button. When done, it displays free memory remaining and a Close button. The patched `.sna` is downloaded after you click Close

The plugin uses `"session": true` to enable the session bar. The 112-byte `dzx0_smartRCS` depacker is placed at `$FE90` (end of memory), keeping the data block at `$A000` portable for sideloading. Packed data must not reach the depacker area — if your edits produce data that compresses poorly, you'll get an error message. ZX0 compressor, RCS reordering and the smart depacker are by Einar Saukas.

### Editing Linear Graphics Across Banks (Hero Quest Plugin)

The Hero Quest plugin demonstrates a common scenario: game graphics stored in non-standard linear format across multiple 128K memory banks.

1. Load `heroquest_128k.slpluginjs`
2. Click **Open…** and select the Hero Quest 128K `.sna` file
3. The plugin extracts 10 graphics (128×64 px each) from banks 3, 4, and 7 — characters like Skeleton, Mummy, Orc, Elf, Knight, etc.
4. Each graphic appears as a full 256×192 SCR with the actual picture at the top-left — the rest is filled with a bright/regular white checkerboard so you can clearly see the editable area
5. Edit the top-left 16×8 character cell region using any drawing tools
6. Click **Save Patched File** — the plugin extracts only the edited region from each SCR, converts it back to linear format, and writes it into the correct bank

The plugin handles the conversion between the game's linear bitmap+attrs layout and the ZX Spectrum's interleaved screen format automatically.

### Exporting with the Cursor Loader Plugin

The Cursor Loader plugin lets you create a `.tap` file where the screen loads cell by cell in any order you choose, with a bright white cursor sweeping from cell to cell. It supports **multiple source images** — you can load several `.scr` files and paint cell regions from different sources, creating picture-replacement effects during tape loading.

1. Open `cursor_loader.slpluginjs` via the main browse button or drag-and-drop to install the plugin
2. Open or draw a `.scr` screen in the editor
3. Click **Export** in the plugin bar — the Cursor Loader Export dialog opens
4. The dialog shows your screen at 2× zoom with a 32×24 grid overlay
5. **Source tabs** appear above the canvas — "Editor" is source 1 (your current screen). Click **+ Add** to load additional `.scr` files as extra sources. Each source gets a distinct color
6. Choose a preset to fill all 768 cells from the active source:
   - **Typewriter** — left to right, top to bottom
   - **Spiral In** — clockwise spiral from the border inward
   - **Random** — shuffled order for a scattered loading effect
7. Or define a custom order interactively:
   - **Left-click/drag** to add cells from the active source (drag draws smooth lines using Bresenham interpolation)
   - **Right-click** to set an anchor point (shown with white corner brackets), then right-click another cell to draw a line of cells between them
   - Switch source tabs to paint cells from different images — the same cell can appear multiple times from different sources
8. Tools: **Clear**, **Fill remaining** (fills uncovered cells from active source), **Undo** (Ctrl+Z), **Redo** (Ctrl+Y)
9. **Save** / **Load** — save the entire project (sources + cell order) to a `.json` file and resume later
10. **Animate** checkbox — preview the loading animation at any time, even with partial coverage
11. **Initial colors** — use the Ink and Paper dropdowns and the **Bright** checkbox to set the screen's initial attribute fill before loading starts. The border color matches the paper. The color swatch shows a preview of ink on paper at the chosen brightness. Default is black on black
12. **Cursor** — the "Show cursor during loading" checkbox controls whether a bright white cell appears ahead of the data during tape loading. Uncheck to hide the cursor
13. **Border stripes** — choose the border stripe color scheme during tape loading: Blue/Yellow (standard), Red/Cyan, Magenta/Green, Black/White, or Solid (no stripes). When Solid is selected, a **Color** dropdown appears to choose any of the 8 ZX Spectrum colors for the solid border
14. Select download format: **ZIP** (includes .tap + .bin + .asm + .inc) or **TAP only**
15. **Include disk emulator ASM** — when ZIP is selected, check this box to add a standalone disk emulator to the archive (`_disk.asm` + `disk_cursor_loader.inc`). The disk emulator reads from the same `.bin` file but from RAM instead of tape. Bitmap bytes appear progressively in monochrome across 3 frames per cell, then color snaps in — same visual as real tape loading. Press any key to skip the remaining reveal. Assembles with sjasmplus
16. Click **Export** when all 768 unique positions are covered (status shows "Entries: N | Unique cells: M / 768")

To test: open the `.tap` in any ZX Spectrum emulator (48K mode) and type `LOAD ""`. The bright white cursor sweeps across the screen in your chosen order, and the picture appears behind it as each cell loads. With multiple sources, you'll see one picture being replaced by another.

To test the disk emulator: assemble `_disk.asm` with sjasmplus (`sjasmplus name_disk.asm`), load the resulting binary in an emulator at $8000, and execute it. The same cell-by-cell cursor effect plays from RAM.

### Analyzing SCA Animations with the Diff Analyzer Plugin

The SCA Diff Analyzer plugin opens Type 0 SCA animations and exports frame-to-frame differences as ASM source with binary data — useful for producing optimized animation players that only update changed cells.

1. Open `sca_diff_analyzer.slpluginjs` via the main browse button or drag-and-drop to install the plugin
2. Open a `.sca` file (must be Type 0, with at least 2 frames) — frame 0 appears in the viewer as a standard SCR
3. Click **Export** in the plugin bar — the SCA Diff Analyzer dialog opens
4. **Diff unit** radio selects what data to compare per cell:
   - **Bitmap + attribute (9 bytes/cell)** — compares 8 bitmap bytes + 1 attribute byte; changed cells export all 9 data bytes plus 2 coordinate bytes (11 bytes/cell total)
   - **Attribute only (1 byte/cell)** — compares only the attribute byte; changed cells export 1 attribute byte plus 2 coordinate bytes (3 bytes/cell total)
5. **Threshold** input (1–768) sets the maximum number of changed cells for a frame to be encoded as a diff. Frames exceeding this are exported as full 6912-byte binaries
6. The **statistics panel** updates live as you adjust settings — shows diff vs full frame counts, estimated sizes in KB, and a color-coded histogram (green = diff frames, red = full frames, yellow dashed line = threshold)
7. Click **Export** → a ZIP downloads containing:
   - `animation_diff/animation.asm` — main ASM file with `Frame_NNN:` labels, `DB`/`INCBIN` data, `DelayTable:`, and a per-frame summary
   - `animation_diff/frame_NNN.bin` — full 6912-byte SCR files for frame 0 and any frames exceeding the diff threshold

### Writing Your Own Plugin

Open any example plugin in a text editor — the `_doc` field at the top explains all fields and the API. JSON descriptor plugins need no coding — just specify addresses, formats, and lengths. JS plugins use `extract()` and `patch()` functions with full access to snapshot memory banks. Add `"session": true` to a JS plugin descriptor if it needs the Save Patched File / Save Raw workflow.

JS plugins also receive an `SL` object with SpectraLab's compression utilities: `SL.ZX0`, `SL.ZX7`, `SL.RLE`, `SL.ZXSC`, `SL.LC`, `SL.UPKR`, `SL.LgK`, `SL.ASC`. Each provides `compress()` and `decompress()` methods. Check availability with `if (SL.ZX0)` before use.

## 24. Using Scripts

The **Script Editor** floating panel lets you automate drawing with a BASIC-style language. This walkthrough covers the basics.

### Running Your First Script

1. Open the Script Editor from the **Tools** tab → **Script Editor** link.
2. Select **Diagonal Line** from the Examples dropdown — this loads:
   ```
   SETINK 7
   LINE 0 0 255 191
   RENDER
   ```
3. Click **▶ Run** (or press **Ctrl+Enter**). A white diagonal line appears across the canvas.
4. Press **Ctrl+Z** to undo — the entire script is reverted in one step.

### Drawing with Loops

Try typing this script to draw random stars:

```
SETINK 7
SETPAPER 0
CLEAR 7 0
REPEAT 200
  PIXEL RANDOM(256) RANDOM(192)
ENDREPEAT
```

Click **▶ Run**. 200 random white pixels appear on a black background.

### Using FOR Loops and Math

Draw a sine wave:

```
SETINK 6
FOR x = 0 TO 255
  LET y = 96 + FLOOR(SIN(x * PI / 32) * 60)
  PIXEL x y
NEXT
```

### Conditional Logic

Change ink color based on position:

```
FOR x = 0 TO 255
  FOR y = 0 TO 191
    IF (x + y) % 2 = 0 THEN
      SETINK 4
    ELSE
      SETINK 5
    ENDIF
    PIXEL x y
  NEXT
NEXT
```

> **Note:** This draws 49,152 pixels — it will yield periodically to keep the browser responsive. Use the **■ Stop** button if needed.

### User-Defined Functions

Create reusable drawing routines:

```
FUNC box(x, y, w, h)
  RECT x y x + w y + h
ENDFUNC

SETINK 7
CALL box(10, 10, 50, 30)
CALL box(80, 40, 60, 60)
CALL box(160, 20, 40, 80)
```

### Reading Screen State

Query the current screen and react:

```
# Invert the top-left 8x8 block
FOR y = 0 TO 7
  FOR x = 0 TO 7
    IF GETPIXEL(x, y) = 1 THEN
      PIXELPAPER x y
    ELSE
      PIXEL x y
    ENDIF
  NEXT
NEXT
```

### Setting Attributes Directly

Set attribute colors per cell without drawing pixels:

```
FOR row = 0 TO 23
  FOR col = 0 TO 31
    SETATTR col row col % 8 row % 8 1 0
  NEXT
NEXT
```

### Saving and Loading Scripts

- Click **Save** to download your script as a `.slscript` file.
- Click **Load** to open a previously saved script.
- Script content is also auto-saved to your browser's local storage.

## 25. Tips and Hidden Features

### Workspace Save/Load
Save all your open pictures at once with **Save Workspace** in the Xform tab. Load them back later — preserving layers, sprites, settings, and reference images. Workspace buttons are always available in the Xform tab, even without a loaded picture.

### Save All Pictures (ZIP / GIF / SCA)
When 2+ pictures are open, the Xform tab shows four extra buttons that bundle every open picture into one file:
- **ZIP (originals)** — every picture in its native binary format (`.scr`, `.bsc`, `.ifl`, …) inside a single zip.
- **ZIP (PNG / GIF)** — every picture rendered with current view settings (zoom, border, palette, filters); flashing pictures become animated GIFs.
- **Animated GIF** — one combined GIF with all pictures as frames at 500 ms each (flashing pictures contribute two phase frames). All pictures must render to the same canvas size.
- **SCA** — one SCA animation with all pictures as SCR frames at 500 ms each. Requires every picture to be plain SCR (256×192, 6912 bytes).

The active picture is restored after each save, so editing isn't disturbed.

### Barcode Brushes
For BSC/BSP/BMC4 border formats, use barcode slots to capture and stamp border stripe patterns. Shift+click a slot to capture from the border.

### Gradient Tool Dither Patterns
The Gradient tool (D) supports 6 gradient types (Linear, Radial, Diamond, Conical, Square, Spiral) with Bayer or Blue Noise dithering. Great for backgrounds.

### Dither Brush Tool
After importing an image, press **W** to activate the Dither Brush. Paint over cells to re-dither them with a different algorithm — useful for mixing dithering styles in one picture (e.g. ordered dithering for sky, Floyd-Steinberg for detailed areas). Choose the method, brush diameter (3–16 px), and strength in the settings panel. The brush is round and pixel-accurate. To re-dither a rectangular region at once, select an area first and press **Shift+W**.

### Tileset Brush Mode
Load a `.768` font file into the brush system to get a tileset tab. Each character becomes a stampable brush — ideal for tile-based game screens.

### Masked Paint Modes
Select a custom brush, set paint mode to **Masked** or **Mask+**, then draw with any brush shape/size. The custom brush acts as a repeating stencil pattern.

### QR Code Generation
Generate QR codes directly on the ZX Spectrum screen via the Tools tab. Supports V1-V20 with adjustable module size (1-8 pixels).

### Memory Viewer for Snapshots
After loading a `.sna` or `.z80` snapshot, use the Memory Viewer to browse raw memory as 1-bit graphics. Navigate by bytes, lines, rows, sprites, or pages. Grab sprites directly from memory into the sprite list.

### Multiple Pictures via Tab Bar
Open multiple files — each gets its own tab. Switch between them instantly. Modified files are marked with a dot.

### Fullscreen Mode
Press **F11** to toggle fullscreen from any tab. In viewer mode, only the canvas is shown (with active display filters). In editor mode, the floating tool palette and preview panel are also visible. Press **Tab** to show/hide the floating tool palette (editor only). Press **Escape** to exit.

### Layers
Use the Layers feature (Edit tab) for non-destructive editing. Add layers, reorder them, and flatten when done. Save projects with layers as `.slp` files.

### Keyboard Layout Independence
All keyboard shortcuts work based on physical key positions, so they function correctly with any keyboard layout (Russian, German, etc.).

### Brush Preview
Press **` (backtick)** to toggle a semi-transparent brush preview that follows your cursor, showing exactly where pixels will be placed.

### Snap Modes
The Snap dropdown in the Edit tab controls how the cursor aligns. Use **Zero** or **Brush** snap modes for pixel-perfect tile placement when pasting repeating patterns.

### 53c/127c Pattern Palette
When editing .53c or .atr files, a pattern color palette replaces the standard ink/paper picker. Sort colors by Hue, RGB value, or attribute byte. Use the "Blend colors" checkbox to see averaged solid colors instead of dither patterns.

### chr$ Format
Open, view, edit, and save `.ch$`/`.chr$`/`.ch-` files — a variable-size interleaved 8x8 cell format with optional Gigascreen support.

### Color Picker Tool
Press **K** to select the Color Picker tool. Works across all editable formats including 53c, ULA+, Gigascreen, and RGB3.

### Grid Color
If the grid overlay is hard to see on dark artwork, change the grid color preset in the Grid section (White, Gray, Black, Orange, Red, Green).

### Light/Dark Theme
Click the moon/sun button (☽/☀) next to the Help button to toggle between light and dark themes. The theme is auto-detected from your OS preference on first visit.

### Display Filters
Apply CRT-style post-processing effects from the Display Filters section in the Tools tab. Choose from presets (CRT TV, Composite, VHS, Arcade) or customize individual effects. Filters are preserved in workspace files.

## ZGS Editor — Drawing Vector Scenes

The ZGS Editor lets you create vector graphics scenes using ZGS (ZX Graphics Script) — a compact bytecode format for ZX Spectrum. Open it from the **Tools** tab → **ZGS Editor**.

### Quick Start: Drawing a Simple Scene

1. Click **New** — you get a template with a blue background and a white rectangle.

2. **Set colors visually:** Use the **Ink...** dropdown on the command toolbar to pick `Yellow`, then check **Brt** for bright mode. This inserts `set_ink yellow bright` into the source.

3. **Draw a rectangle:** Click the **RectF** tool in the shape toolbar. Drag on the canvas to define a filled rectangle. A yellow rubber-band shows the preview. On release, `rect_fill_abs x, y, w, h` is inserted and the canvas updates instantly.

4. **Draw a circle:** Click **Circle**, drag from center outward. Release to insert `circle_outline_abs cx, cy, r`.

5. **Add a line:** Click **Line**, left-drag from start to end. This inserts `move_abs x0, y0` followed by `line_dmed dx, dy`. For multi-segment polylines, **right-drag** instead — after releasing, a rubber band continues from the endpoint; right-drag again to add more segments, left click or Esc to finish.

6. **Place dots:** Click **Dot**, then click individual points on the canvas.

7. **Clear a region:** Click **ClearR**, drag over the area you want to clear. The selection snaps to 8×8 character cells (shown as a red dashed rectangle). This inserts `clear_region col, row, w, h, attr`.

8. **Add text:** Click **Text**, then click a character cell on the canvas to place `set_cursor col, row`. Type your text in the toolbar input field and click **Print** to insert `print_text "..."`. Text is rendered using the ZX Spectrum ROM font (8×8). Cursor placement and text printing are separate commands, so you can draw between them.

### Using the Command Toolbar

The second toolbar row provides quick insertion of non-drawing commands:

- Pick **Ink** or **Paper** from the dropdowns to change colors. Check **Brt** for bright variants. The dropdown label updates to show the current selection (e.g., "Ink: red").
- Pick a **Pattern** (Solid, Empty, Checker, Dots25, Dots12, Horiz, Vert, Diag) for pattern-filled shapes.
- Click **XOR** to switch to XOR drawing mode (pixels toggle instead of being set). Click **SET** to go back.
- Click **Clear** to insert a full-screen clear with the current attribute.
- Click **WaitKey** to pause playback until a key is pressed (useful for multi-scene animations).

### Coordinate Picking

Hover over the canvas to see coordinates in the tooltip (top-right) and status bar. When you need to type coordinates manually:

- **Left-click** with the **Cursor** tool copies `lx, ly` to your clipboard
- **Right-click** anywhere also copies coordinates to clipboard

Paste them into your source code wherever needed.

### Step-by-Step Debugging

Click **Step** to execute one opcode at a time. The editor highlights the current source line in the textarea, and the pen crosshair (green, semi-transparent) shows where the pen is on the canvas.

Use **Play** for continuous animated playback. Adjust the **Speed** slider to control the delay between steps.

### Grid Overlay

Check the **Grid** checkbox to show an 8×8 character cell grid over the canvas. Thin orange lines mark every character cell boundary. Two brighter lines at y=64 and y=128 mark the screen third boundaries (important for ZX Spectrum screen memory layout). The grid state persists across sessions.

### Theme Toggle

Click the **☾/☀** button in the header bar to switch between dark and light themes. The theme syncs with the main SpectraLab and Font Editor — changing it in one place updates all editors.

### Multi-Scene Projects

The ZGS Editor supports multiple scenes in a single project. Use the tab bar below the header to manage scenes:

1. Click the **+** button to add a new scene
2. Click a tab to switch between scenes — each scene has its own source text, undo/redo history, and preview
3. Double-click a tab name to rename it
4. Click the **×** button on a tab to delete it (at least one scene must remain)

Save your multi-scene project by clicking **Save** and choosing **Save .zgp** to preserve all scenes. Load it later by opening a `.zgp` file or by dragging it onto the page.

### Saving Your Work

Click the **Save** button to open a dropdown menu with format choices:

- **Save .zgs** — assemble and save the active scene as compact binary (for use in ZX Spectrum programs)
- **Save .zgt** — save the active scene as human-readable text source (for continued editing)
- **Save .zgp** — save the entire multi-scene project for later editing
- **Save .asm** — export all scenes as a complete sjasmplus Z80 assembly file with the ZGS player library. Downloads a `.zip` containing the `.asm` file, compiled `.zgs` binaries for each scene, and a packed text dictionary. Run `sjasmplus project.asm` to produce a ready-to-run `.sna` snapshot

The exported `.asm` file uses a config block with 4 JP entry points at fixed addresses. You can programmatically select which scene to display by poking the scene index into `scene_num` (ORG+0x12) and calling `show_by_num` (ORG+0x03). The `clear_color` field (ORG+0x13) controls the attribute byte used when clearing the screen.

### Conditional Compilation

The exported `.asm` file includes `DEFINE` flags at the top for each optional feature group. All are enabled by default. Comment out any `DEFINE` line to exclude that feature from the binary, reducing size. Each comment shows the approximate byte savings:

| DEFINE | ~Bytes | Feature |
|--------|-------:|---------|
| `ZGS_USE_LINES` | 443 | Line, hline, vline drawing |
| `ZGS_USE_RECTS` | 636 | Rectangle outline/fill, clear_region |
| `ZGS_USE_CIRCLES` | 612 | Circle outline/fill |
| `ZGS_USE_POLYGONS` | 666 | Polygon outline/fill |
| `ZGS_USE_FLOOD` | 2166 | Flood fill (includes 1280 bytes of buffers) |
| `ZGS_USE_TEXT` | 180 | set_cursor, print_text (+ 768-byte font_8x8.bin) |
| `ZGS_USE_PACKED_TEXT` | 724 | print_packed (includes ~520 byte dictionary) |
| `ZGS_USE_TEXT_42` | 968 | 42-col text (+ 768-byte font_6x8.bin) |
| `ZGS_USE_TEXT_64` | 968 | 64-col text (+ 768-byte font_4x8.bin) |
| `ZGS_USE_STAMPS` | 146 | Stamp (sprite blit) |

`ZGS_USE_TEXT`, `ZGS_USE_TEXT_42`, and `ZGS_USE_TEXT_64` are auto-detected from the scene source — they are enabled only when the corresponding text opcodes are used. Other DEFINEs are active by default. Each text mode includes its font binary via `incbin`; you can replace any `font_*.bin` with a custom font.

For example, if your scene only uses lines and 42-col text:

```asm
    DEFINE ZGS_USE_LINES
;   DEFINE ZGS_USE_RECTS
;   DEFINE ZGS_USE_CIRCLES
;   DEFINE ZGS_USE_POLYGONS
;   DEFINE ZGS_USE_FLOOD
;   DEFINE ZGS_USE_TEXT
    DEFINE ZGS_USE_PACKED_TEXT
    DEFINE ZGS_USE_TEXT_42
;   DEFINE ZGS_USE_TEXT_64
;   DEFINE ZGS_USE_STAMPS
```

If you disable all drawing features (lines, rects, circles, polygons, flood, stamps) and keep only text, the coordinate system — dot/move handlers, `plot_pixel`, math helpers, and pattern/mask tables — is automatically excluded via the internal `ZGS_HAS_DRAWING` flag, saving additional space.

Dependencies: `ZGS_USE_PACKED_TEXT` requires `ZGS_USE_TEXT`. Rect outlines and polygon outlines call `draw_line`, so if you use those, keep `ZGS_USE_LINES` enabled too. The user is responsible for ensuring disabled opcodes don't appear in the scene data.

After assembling, the output shows `size: NNNN` — the total binary size in bytes, so you can see the effect of disabling features.

### Tips

- All drawing tools insert instructions **before** the `end` statement automatically.
- You can freely mix visual drawing with manual text editing — the text is always the source of truth.
- Lines after `end` are ignored by the assembler, so you can add notes there.
- The preview auto-renders 500 ms after you stop typing.

## ZGS Editor — Drawing Vector Scenes

The ZGS Editor lets you create vector graphics scenes using ZGS (ZX Graphics Script) — a compact bytecode format for ZX Spectrum. Open it from the **Tools** tab → **ZGS Editor**.

### Quick Start: Drawing a Simple Scene

1. Click **New** — you get a template with a blue background and a white rectangle.

2. **Set colors visually:** Use the **Ink...** dropdown on the command toolbar to pick `Yellow`, then check **Brt** for bright mode. This inserts `set_ink yellow bright` into the source.

3. **Draw a rectangle:** Click the **RectF** tool in the shape toolbar. Drag on the canvas to define a filled rectangle. A yellow rubber-band shows the preview. On release, `rect_fill_abs x, y, w, h` is inserted and the canvas updates instantly.

4. **Draw a circle:** Click **Circle**, drag from center outward. Release to insert `circle_outline_abs cx, cy, r`.

5. **Add a line:** Click **Line**, left-drag from start to end. This inserts `move_abs x0, y0` followed by `line_dmed dx, dy`. For multi-segment polylines, **right-drag** instead — after releasing, a rubber band continues from the endpoint; right-drag again to add more segments, left click or Esc to finish.

6. **Place dots:** Click **Dot**, then click individual points on the canvas.

7. **Clear a region:** Click **ClearR**, drag over the area you want to clear. The selection snaps to 8×8 character cells (shown as a red dashed rectangle). This inserts `clear_region col, row, w, h, attr`.

8. **Add text:** Click **Text**, then click a character cell on the canvas to place `set_cursor col, row`. Type your text in the toolbar input field and click **Print** to insert `print_text "..."`. Text is rendered using the ZX Spectrum ROM font (8×8). Cursor placement and text printing are separate commands, so you can draw between them.

### Using the Command Toolbar

The second toolbar row provides quick insertion of non-drawing commands:

- Pick **Ink** or **Paper** from the dropdowns to change colors. Check **Brt** for bright variants. The dropdown label updates to show the current selection (e.g., "Ink: red").
- Pick a **Pattern** (Solid, Empty, Checker, Dots25, Dots12, Horiz, Vert, Diag) for pattern-filled shapes.
- Click **XOR** to switch to XOR drawing mode (pixels toggle instead of being set). Click **SET** to go back.
- Click **Clear** to insert a full-screen clear with the current attribute.
- Click **WaitKey** to pause playback until a key is pressed (useful for multi-scene animations).

### Coordinate Picking

Hover over the canvas to see coordinates in the tooltip (top-right) and status bar. When you need to type coordinates manually:

- **Left-click** with the **Cursor** tool copies `lx, ly` to your clipboard
- **Right-click** anywhere also copies coordinates to clipboard

Paste them into your source code wherever needed.

### Step-by-Step Debugging

Click **Step** to execute one opcode at a time. The editor highlights the current source line in the textarea, and the pen crosshair (green, semi-transparent) shows where the pen is on the canvas.

Use **Play** for continuous animated playback. Adjust the **Speed** slider to control the delay between steps.

### Grid Overlay

Check the **Grid** checkbox to show an 8×8 character cell grid over the canvas. Thin orange lines mark every character cell boundary. Two brighter lines at y=64 and y=128 mark the screen third boundaries (important for ZX Spectrum screen memory layout). The grid state persists across sessions.

### Theme Toggle

Click the **☾/☀** button in the header bar to switch between dark and light themes. The theme syncs with the main SpectraLab and Font Editor — changing it in one place updates all editors.

### Multi-Scene Projects

The ZGS Editor supports multiple scenes in a single project. Use the tab bar below the header to manage scenes:

1. Click the **+** button to add a new scene
2. Click a tab to switch between scenes — each scene has its own source text, undo/redo history, and preview
3. Double-click a tab name to rename it
4. Click the **×** button on a tab to delete it (at least one scene must remain)

Save your multi-scene project by clicking **Save** and choosing **Save .zgp** to preserve all scenes. Load it later by opening a `.zgp` file or by dragging it onto the page.

### Saving Your Work

Click the **Save** button to open a dropdown menu with format choices:

- **Save .zgs** — assemble and save the active scene as compact binary (for use in ZX Spectrum programs)
- **Save .zgt** — save the active scene as human-readable text source (for continued editing)
- **Save .zgp** — save the entire multi-scene project for later editing
- **Save .asm** — export all scenes as a complete sjasmplus Z80 assembly file with the ZGS player library. Downloads a `.zip` containing the `.asm` file, compiled `.zgs` binaries for each scene, and a packed text dictionary. Run `sjasmplus project.asm` to produce a ready-to-run `.sna` snapshot

The exported `.asm` file uses a config block with 4 JP entry points at fixed addresses. You can programmatically select which scene to display by poking the scene index into `scene_num` (ORG+0x12) and calling `show_by_num` (ORG+0x03). The `clear_color` field (ORG+0x13) controls the attribute byte used when clearing the screen.

### Conditional Compilation

The exported `.asm` file includes `DEFINE` flags at the top for each optional feature group. All are enabled by default. Comment out any `DEFINE` line to exclude that feature from the binary, reducing size. Each comment shows the approximate byte savings:

| DEFINE | ~Bytes | Feature |
|--------|-------:|---------|
| `ZGS_USE_LINES` | 443 | Line, hline, vline drawing |
| `ZGS_USE_RECTS` | 636 | Rectangle outline/fill, clear_region |
| `ZGS_USE_CIRCLES` | 612 | Circle outline/fill |
| `ZGS_USE_POLYGONS` | 666 | Polygon outline/fill |
| `ZGS_USE_FLOOD` | 2166 | Flood fill (includes 1280 bytes of buffers) |
| `ZGS_USE_TEXT` | 180 | set_cursor, print_text (+ 768-byte font_8x8.bin) |
| `ZGS_USE_PACKED_TEXT` | 724 | print_packed (includes ~520 byte dictionary) |
| `ZGS_USE_TEXT_42` | 968 | 42-col text (+ 768-byte font_6x8.bin) |
| `ZGS_USE_TEXT_64` | 968 | 64-col text (+ 768-byte font_4x8.bin) |
| `ZGS_USE_STAMPS` | 146 | Stamp (sprite blit) |

`ZGS_USE_TEXT`, `ZGS_USE_TEXT_42`, and `ZGS_USE_TEXT_64` are auto-detected from the scene source — they are enabled only when the corresponding text opcodes are used. Other DEFINEs are active by default. Each text mode includes its font binary via `incbin`; you can replace any `font_*.bin` with a custom font.

For example, if your scene only uses lines and 42-col text:

```asm
    DEFINE ZGS_USE_LINES
;   DEFINE ZGS_USE_RECTS
;   DEFINE ZGS_USE_CIRCLES
;   DEFINE ZGS_USE_POLYGONS
;   DEFINE ZGS_USE_FLOOD
;   DEFINE ZGS_USE_TEXT
    DEFINE ZGS_USE_PACKED_TEXT
    DEFINE ZGS_USE_TEXT_42
;   DEFINE ZGS_USE_TEXT_64
;   DEFINE ZGS_USE_STAMPS
```

If you disable all drawing features (lines, rects, circles, polygons, flood, stamps) and keep only text, the coordinate system — dot/move handlers, `plot_pixel`, math helpers, and pattern/mask tables — is automatically excluded via the internal `ZGS_HAS_DRAWING` flag, saving additional space.

Dependencies: `ZGS_USE_PACKED_TEXT` requires `ZGS_USE_TEXT`. Rect outlines and polygon outlines call `draw_line`, so if you use those, keep `ZGS_USE_LINES` enabled too. The user is responsible for ensuring disabled opcodes don't appear in the scene data.

After assembling, the output shows `size: NNNN` — the total binary size in bytes, so you can see the effect of disabling features.

### Tips

- All drawing tools insert instructions **before** the `end` statement automatically.
- You can freely mix visual drawing with manual text editing — the text is always the source of truth.
- Lines after `end` are ignored by the assembler, so you can add notes there.
