# SpectraLab Version History

## v2.43
- Added **Combine** (Tools, or when opening several .scr at once) — joins pictures into one larger **chr$** losslessly
- Added a **Settings** dialog (gear next to **?**) — configurable mouse and arrow-key bindings: wheel zoom, Ctrl/Shift+Wheel scroll, middle-drag pan, Alt+LMB pick, Alt+RMB recolor
- Added a **pixel cursor** — set arrow keys to move it (Settings) for exact placement: Shift+arrow steps 8 pixels, Space applies the current tool, and it follows the mouse; shape is corner marks, corner dots or a full box
- Added **preview visibility in fullscreen** to Settings — it only appeared when editing, now it can be forced on or off
- Fixed **color picker** — BRIGHT was never picked, clicks outside 256x192 on large chr$/ZXP did nothing, and gigascreen chr$/ZXP and GMX picked from the wrong place

## v2.42
- Added **hidden colors** — **Alt+click a palette swatch** to hide that color from the editing canvas, where it renders as the transparency checkerboard; Alt+click again or **Show all** restores it. View filter only: the preview panel, saved files and exported images always contain every color
- Works in every palette — standard ZX (a swatch covers normal + BRIGHT), ULA+, ULANext, Gigascreen virtual colors, Next Layer 2 / LoRes / Radastan, RGB3, and 53c pattern colors (which hide the whole cell)

## v2.41
- Added **"Floyd Attr-Aware" dithering** (new import default) — DaDither-style two-pass conversion: each attribute cell's ink/paper pair is chosen from the original (pre-dither) image, then a single global Floyd-Steinberg pass quantizes every pixel to its cell's pair with error flowing across cell boundaries. The diffusion runs in a **gamma-1.5 working space** — a dither pattern mixes optically (averages linear intensities), so raw sRGB-space diffusion renders midtones far too light and washed out, while pure linear overshoots into darkness (the same reason print workflows compensate dot gain); gamma 1.5 lands on DaDither's tone. Error crossing an attribute-cell boundary is damped (×0.4) so it can't discharge as pixel debris hugging cell edges. Only the error component along each cell's ink→paper axis is diffused — the orthogonal "hue debt" is unrepresentable and would otherwise discharge as ink lines drawn exactly along attribute borders. Combines the natural per-cell colors of Cell Floyd with the seamless gradients of global dithering — no cell seams, no noise-locked attribute colors. Implemented for SCR, ZXP and the BSC main-screen path; other cell formats transparently fall back to Cell Floyd, non-cell formats to global Floyd-Steinberg
- Added **"Ordered Attr-Aware" dithering** — same per-cell pair selection as Floyd Attr-Aware, but thresholded against a Bayer 8×8 matrix instead of diffusing error: the clean, regular patterning of classic hand-pixelled ZX art, with no error-diffusion worms and no cross-cell debris
- Improved **Blend fit** pair selection — projection now works in *linear light* (a dither pattern mixes optically, i.e. averages linear intensities, not sRGB values — this alone fixes magenta being chosen for skin tones), and a grain penalty `t·(1−t)·|ink−paper|²` (the dither pattern's variance) makes close, flat pairs win over noisy high-contrast blends when both fit equally well
- The **Colors dropdown (RGB/LAB/OkLab) now drives Blend fit's residual metric** (it was ignored by the new pipeline): the mix ratio is still found in linear light, but how far a pixel sits from the achievable blend is measured in the selected space. In practice: **RGB** gives the darker, DaDither-like colorization with strong luminance contrast; **OkLab/LAB** pick lighter pairs that favor hue fidelity over contrast (faces can wash out). The import default is now **RGB** accordingly (was OkLab)
- Changed **import defaults** to match: Pair fit **Blend fit** (was Best fit — Blend fit evaluates how well a color pair *dithers together*, giving far more natural attribute colors), dither strength **90%** (was 100%), **serpentine scan on** (was off). Opening a file now resets the dither method to Floyd Attr-Aware (previously reset to None)
- Fixed **global error-diffusion modes locking attribute colors onto dither noise** — with global methods (Floyd-Steinberg, Jarvis, etc.) the per-cell ink/paper pair is now chosen from the pre-dither image instead of the already-dithered speckle, eliminating random saturated cells
- Fixed **error-diffusion runaway** — accumulated diffusion error is now clamped to the 0-255 range during all error-diffusion scans, preventing oversaturated speckle (pure cyan/magenta/green pixels) in high-contrast areas at high strength

## v2.40
- Added **ASC** screen compressor (`.scr.asc`) — port of *ASC v2.9* (Andrew Strikes Code, 1997), LZSS + RLE. Available in Compression Compare and the Save As dropdown, with sjasmplus ASM export
- ASC files open directly — both bare token streams and self-extracting blocks (194-byte depacker stub auto-detected)
- Added **"Save INVERSE codes" option** for `.specscii` export (SPECSCII editor sidebar) — fixes inverted pictures rendering as a black screen in the ZXArt online viewer, which doesn't support the `INVERSE` (`0x14`) control code. When **off** (now the default), inverted cells are baked in by swapping ink/paper — visually identical and compatible with viewers that ignore the control code. When on, `INVERSE` control codes are written as before. Applies to single-layer and multi-layer streams plus `.tap` export; the choice persists in localStorage. Added serializer tests (`editor-test.html`) covering both modes

## v2.39
- Fixed **editor Preview panel becoming unrecoverable** — dragging the small preview to the left/top edge and then zooming it out could push it fully off-screen with no way to bring it back. The panel is now clamped so its header (with the drag handle) always stays on-screen, and it is re-clamped after every zoom change and on window resize
- Added **Preview panel position persistence** — the small editor preview panel now remembers its position across sessions (saved to localStorage). If a saved position would land off-screen (e.g. from a smaller window), it is nudged back into view a little away from the edge when the panel is shown
- Removed the automatic **`_edited` suffix** added to filenames when saving an edited screen — the file now keeps its original name, leaving it to the user (or the browser's duplicate-name handling) to decide on a new name
- Internal: deduplicated filename and save-state code — extracted a shared `stripFileExtension()` helper (replacing ~30 inline `replace(/\.[^.]+$/, '')` copies across the screen editor, image import, plugin manager, and snapshot loader) and a `markPictureUnmodified()` helper (replacing 9 copies of the active-picture reset block in the save paths). No behavior change
- Internal: simplified `saveScrFile()` — the six near-identical per-format export blocks (chr$, Nirvana tiles, ZXP, MGH, HLR, STL, BSP) now share a `finalizeSave()` filename/download/mark helper and reuse the existing `syncCurrentPicture()` function, removing ~110 lines of copy-paste. No behavior change
- Internal: added an `isGigaattrFormat()` predicate and replaced ~24 inline `FORMAT.GIGAATTR || FORMAT.GIGAATTR_PLUS` checks with it; replaced ~70 inline ZX attribute bit-twiddling expressions with the `ATTR.ink/paper/bright/flash/make` helpers; and switched the clear screen-size length checks to the `SCREEN.ATTR_SIZE`/`SCREEN.BITMAP_SIZE` constants. All value-identical, no behavior change
- Added **manual number entry to the SCA editor** — the *Trim from Start*, *Trim from End*, and *Frame Delay* fields can now be typed into directly (Enter or click-away to apply) instead of only clicking +/− repeatedly. Values are clamped to their valid ranges (trims keep at least one frame; delay 1–255) and the field is corrected if an out-of-range or invalid value is entered. Focusing a field selects its contents so typing replaces the value

## v2.38
- Added **Cursor Loader zoom selector** (x1 / x2 / x3 / x4) — radio buttons in the export dialog control canvas magnification. The canvas displays at native pixel size and the dialog resizes to fit. Zoom level persists in localStorage across dialog reopens
- Changed **Cursor Loader presets to append** instead of replacing — presets now add cells on top of existing cell order using the active source, enabling multi-source layered schemes (e.g. source 1 as Typewriter, then source 2 as Zigzag, then source 3 as Columns). Each preset application is a single undo step
- Reorganized **Cursor Loader dialog** into three tabs below the canvas — **Settings** (initial colors, animate), **Presets** (preset buttons, clear/fill/undo/redo/save/load), **Export** (cursor option, border stripes, download format, disk emulator). Cancel and Export buttons remain always visible below the tabs. Two-column layout in the Export tab places cursor/stripe options beside the format selector to reduce vertical height
- Fixed **Compression Compare** duplicate column headers — removed the second pair of "Depacker" and "Total" headers that had no corresponding data cells
- Changed **Compression Compare auto-selection** to pick the method with the best **Total** savings (compressed size savings minus depacker overhead) instead of the smallest raw compressed size. This correctly accounts for depacker cost when recommending the best method

## v2.37
- Improved **Sprite Editor color palette** — replaced the single 8-color row with Bright checkbox by two rows: top row shows the 8 normal colors, bottom row shows the 8 bright colors. Left-click selects ink, right-click selects paper (same as before). Clicking a color in either row automatically sets the bright flag to match that row, moving both ink and paper selections together — no need to toggle a separate checkbox. The palette now uses the colors from the View tab Palette selection instead of hardcoded ZX values — changing the display palette (e.g. to Pulsar, CGA, etc.) immediately updates the sprite editor swatches and canvas rendering
- Fixed **Sprite Editor "+ Add" button** ignoring the Mode and Size dropdowns — previously always created 1×1 mono sprites regardless of the dropdown values. Now reads the current Mode selection (Mono, Attributed, Multicolour) and W/H cell size so new sprites are created with the correct mode, size, and attribute data from the start
- Added **GA/GAP pattern mode** — compact pattern-based variants of Gigaattr and Gigaattr+ULA+ formats (same concept as HLR). Instead of a full 6144-byte bitmap, pattern files store an 8-byte fill pattern tile replicated across all 32×24 cells. File sizes: GA pattern 1546 bytes, GAP shared pattern 1610 bytes, GAP dual pattern 1674 bytes. Full support: open/save (auto-detected by size), create new pictures via New dialog, image import with fill pattern selector, 53c → GA/GAP pattern conversion with combined settings dialog (pattern grid + border color selectors). Drawing in pattern mode is attribute-only
- Added **DD/77 pattern** — new fill pattern preset (`DD DD 77 77 DD DD 77 77`) available in 53c, HLR, and GA/GAP pattern selectors
- Added **Disk emulator ASM** option to the **Tape Loader** plugin — when exporting a non-turbo scheme as ZIP, a new "Include disk emulator ASM" checkbox adds two extra files to the archive: a standalone `.asm` wrapper and a `.inc` file with Z80 assembly that visually simulates the same loading effect as the tape loader, but reads from a RAM buffer (`INCBIN`) instead of tape. Uses the same reordered `.scr` file as the tape loader (monoloader concept). Timing matches real tape speed: 4 bytes are written to screen memory per frame (1728 HALTs = ~34.6 seconds at 50fps for a full 6912-byte screen). Press any key during the reveal to show the remaining screen instantly — a single `HALT` instruction in the `check_key` subroutine is patched to `NOP` via self-modifying code, so all subsequent waits return immediately. Available for all five non-turbo schemes (Backward, Linear, Checkerboard 2×2/4×3/8×6). Assembles with sjasmplus at ORG $8000. **Cursor Loader** plugin now has the same option — when ZIP is selected, the checkbox adds `_disk.asm` + `disk_cursor_loader.inc` to the archive. Uses the same compact stream `.bin` (monoloader). Timing matches real tape speed: 3 HALTs per cell (~60ms ≈ tape's ~62ms); bitmap bytes appear progressively in monochrome (cursor attribute) across 3 frames, then the attribute byte snaps the color in — same visual as real tape loading

## v2.36
- Added **GAP (.gap)** format — Gigaattr with appended ULA+ palette. Same shared-bitmap + two-attr-frame layout as `.ga`, plus 64-byte ULA+ GRB332 palette(s) at the end. Two file sizes: 7744 bytes (shared palette for both frames) and 7808 bytes (dual palette — independent palette per frame). Full support: open/save `.gap` files, create new pictures, Gigascreen-compatible editing with ULA+ 64-color palette grid, format conversion (GA ↔ GAP, Gigascreen ↔ GAP, shared ↔ dual palette toggle), and ASM export as a 48K viewer with ULA+ palette programming (shared palette: program once then alternate attrs; dual palette: reprogram palette each frame). Dual-palette rendering: frame 1 uses palette 1, frame 2 uses palette 2, correctly applied in both blend and flicker Gigascreen display modes. View tab shows "(shared palette)" or "(dual palette)" in format info. **CLUT page tabs** for dual-palette mode: the 1024-entry ink grid and 1024-entry paper grid are split into 4 CLUT pages (256 entries each) with tab buttons 0–3. Each page shows frame 1 colors from one CLUT (8 inks) × all 32 frame 2 colors. Standard gigascreen (136 entries) keeps its unpaginated grid
- Added **GAP image import** — GAP (.gap) is now available as a target format in the Image Import dialog. Uses the same conversion algorithm as Gigaattr (GA): shared bitmap with two attribute frames, optimizing blended color pairs from the 136-color Gigascreen palette. A default ULA+ palette (matching standard ZX colors) is appended automatically; the palette can be edited after import via the ULA+ palette grid in Screen 1 / Screen 2 edit mode
- Added **GAP Dual image import** — a separate "GAP Dual" option in the Image Import format dropdown generates two independent 64-color ULA+ palettes (one per frame) for richer color blends. Palette 1 is generated with the standard optimal algorithm; palette 2 is a complement palette that emphasizes colors palette 1 missed (pixel frequencies are reweighted by distance to nearest palette 1 entry). Supports external palettes: 128-byte → split into two 64-byte palettes; 64-byte → use as palette 1, auto-generate complement palette 2. Output is a 7808-byte .gap file (13824-byte screenData + 128-byte dual palette). Preview in the import dialog renders correctly with per-frame palette lookups
- Improved **Gigascreen palette UI** for dual-palette GAP mode — the paper color grid now has independent click selection (left-click = set paper color); ink and paper grids show separate selection markers without cross-interaction. Palette hint label updates dynamically ("Click = Ink" for ink grid when paper strip is visible). Paper preview swatch correctly displays the actual paper blend color from the dual palette instead of the ink blend. Switched palette cell event from `click` to `mousedown` for more reliable selection on small swatches. Removed CSS grid gap to eliminate dead zones between palette cells; selection indicators use `outline` instead of `border-width` change to prevent layout shifts

## v2.35
- Added **Gigaattr (.ga)** format — a Gigascreen variant with one shared 6144-byte bitmap and two 768-byte attribute frames (7680 bytes on disk). Produces 2 blended colors per 8×8 cell from the 136-color Gigascreen palette. Full support: open/save `.ga` files, create new pictures, image import with dedicated converter (optimizes pairs of blended ZX colors per cell), Gigascreen-compatible editing (split Screen 1/Screen 2 for per-frame attribute editing, combined Gigascreen mode), format conversion (Gigascreen ↔ Gigaattr), and ASM export as a minimal 48K viewer (LDIR bitmap once, then alternate two 768-byte attr blocks each frame via HALT+LDIR)

## v2.34
- Added **SCA Diff Analyzer** plugin (`sca_diff_analyzer.slpluginjs`) — opens Type 0 SCA animations and exports frame-to-frame cell-level diffs as a ZIP archive with sjasmplus `.asm` source and binary `.bin` files. Open the `.slpluginjs` file via the main browse button or drag-and-drop to install the plugin, then open a `.sca` file through it; frame 0 is shown in the viewer. Click Export to open the diff analyzer dialog with: **Diff unit** radio (Bitmap + attribute at 9 bytes/cell, or Attribute only at 1 byte/cell), **Threshold** input (max changed cells before falling back to full binary frame), and a **live statistics panel** with color-coded per-frame detail list showing each transition's changed cell count, type (diff/full), and byte size. Frame 0 is always exported as a full 6912-byte `.bin`. Subsequent frames within threshold are exported as cell-level diffs in ASM `DB` directives (row, col, bitmap bytes, attribute byte); frames exceeding threshold are exported as full `.bin` files with `INCBIN` references. The ASM file includes frame labels, delay table, and a per-frame summary with byte counts
- Removed **Load Plugin…** button from the Tools tab — plugins are now loaded through the main browse button or drag-and-drop, the same way as any other file. The `.slplugin` / `.slpluginjs` extensions are auto-detected and routed to the plugin loader. The Plugins section in the Tools tab still shows installed plugins with Open, Export, and Remove controls

## v2.33
- Added **Gigascreen split-screen editing** — a Screen 1 / Screen 2 / Gigascreen mode selector appears in the editor sidebar when a Gigascreen-family format is loaded (.img, MGH, HLR, STL, BSP gigascreen). **Screen 1** and **Screen 2** modes show a single frame on the main canvas with the standard 16-color ZX palette for direct per-frame editing; the floating preview always shows the blended Gigascreen result. **Gigascreen** mode (default) restores the combined virtual 136-color palette. Pixel tools, color picker, eyedropper, flood fill, clear screen, copy/paste, and undo/redo all work correctly in split mode. Keyboard shortcuts: **Alt+1** = Screen 1, **Alt+2** = Screen 2, **Alt+3** = Gigascreen. Mode resets to Gigascreen on file/format change

## v2.32
- Fixed **Cursor Loader** "Solid (no stripes)" border mode — previously produced corrupted picture data due to a hand-crafted byte reader that diverged from the ROM routine. Now uses LDIR to copy the real ROM tape byte reader ($05C6–$0604, 63 bytes) into uncontended RAM at $8000 at MC startup, patches 3 absolute addresses for relocation (CALL/JP targets), and replaces the OUT ($FE),A instruction with NOP NOP to suppress border color changes during loading. An explicit OUT sets the solid border color once before data reading begins
- Added **Solid border color** selector to the **Cursor Loader** export dialog — when "Solid (no stripes)" is chosen in the Border stripes dropdown, a **Color** dropdown appears allowing any of the 8 ZX Spectrum colors (Black, Blue, Red, Magenta, Green, Cyan, Yellow, White) to be selected as the solid border color. Previously solid mode always used the paper color. Setting is preserved in localStorage

## v2.31
- Added **Tape Loader** plugin (`tape_loader.slpluginjs`) — export screen data rearranged for visual tape loading effects. Load the plugin via Tools tab, click Export to choose a loading scheme and download format. Custom export dialog with radio buttons for scheme selection and download format (ZIP archive or .scr only). ZIP includes the .scr, sjasmplus .asm source, and a reusable loader `.inc` file. Six schemes: **Backward (5AFF→4000)** — reverses all 6912 bytes so the loader stores them from $5AFF down to $4000; attrs appear first then bitmap fills from bottom up. **Linear (top→bottom)** — reorders data in character-row order (8 bitmap lines + 32 attr bytes per row); picture paints top to bottom with colors appearing after each row. **Checkerboard 2×2** — divides the screen into a 2×2 grid of 16×12 character blocks, loads even-positioned blocks first then odd, creating a checkerboard fill-in effect. **Checkerboard 4×3** — 4×3 grid of 8×8 character blocks, same checkerboard pattern with finer granularity. **Checkerboard 8×6** — 8×6 grid of 4×4 character blocks, finest checkerboard pattern. Each block loads bitmap data first then attributes. **Turbo Linear (2× speed)** — exports a `.tzx` file with a standard-speed BASIC block containing a custom turbo loader in a REM line, followed by a turbo-speed data block (TZX Block $11) at approximately 2× standard speed. The turbo MC uses edge-detection on port $FE with a threshold-based bit discriminator, running from uncontended RAM at $8000. Returns to BASIC via RST $08 ("0 OK" report). Based on turbo loading technique from zxctl by iratahack. The first five schemes use ROM routines (`$0562` for pilot/sync/flag, `$05C6` for byte reading with DE=0 trick) to load a HEADLESS data block (flag `$FE`). Two tape blocks only (BASIC + HEADLESS data)
- Upgraded **Cursor Loader** plugin (`cursor_loader.slpluginjs`) to **multi-source** — load multiple `.scr` files as sources and paint cell regions from different images. The same cell position can appear multiple times from different sources, creating a "one picture replacing another" effect during tape loading. Source tab bar above the canvas shows colored tabs for each source (Editor + loaded .scr files); click a tab to switch active source, click × to remove. Cell order entries now exceed 768 when using multiple sources; export is enabled once all 768 unique positions are covered. Visual feedback: unassigned cells show diagonal cross pattern, active source cells at full brightness with colored border, other source cells tinted with source color overlay. **Right-click line drawing**: first right-click sets an anchor (shown with white corner brackets), second right-click draws a Bresenham line of cells from anchor to target. **Smooth drag painting**: mouse drag interpolates between events using Bresenham to fill gaps. **Undo/Redo**: Ctrl+Z / Ctrl+Y with full redo stack (new actions clear redo). **Animate** checkbox replaces auto-start — preview animation at any time, even with partial coverage; animation duration scales with entry count. **Save/Load project**: saves full state (all sources as base64, cell order, source names) to `.json` file for resuming later. Tools row: Clear, Fill remaining, Undo, Redo, Save, Load, Animate. Z80 MC unchanged in structure — processes N cells with N×2 byte table and N×9 byte data. ZIP export includes `.bin` (variable-size cell-ordered data) instead of fixed 6912-byte `.scr`
- Added **Initial colors** option to the **Cursor Loader** export dialog — Ink, Paper, and **Bright** controls set the initial attribute fill and border color before tape loading begins. The screen starts with the chosen paper color instead of always black. Attribute byte (including bright bit) is passed through to the Z80 MC which fills $5800-$5AFF and sets the border via `OUT ($FE)`. A color swatch renders the ZX ROM "A" glyph in ink on paper at the chosen brightness. Setting is preserved in Save/Load project
- Added **Cursor toggle** to the **Cursor Loader** export dialog — a "Show cursor during loading" checkbox controls whether the bright white cursor cell ($78) appears ahead of the loading data. When unchecked, cells load without a visible cursor marker. Applies to both the TAP output and the ASM reference. Setting is preserved in Save/Load project
- Added **Border stripes** option to the **Cursor Loader** export dialog — a dropdown selects the border stripe color scheme during tape loading: **Blue/Yellow** (standard ROM behavior), **Red/Cyan**, **Magenta/Green**, **Black/White**, or **Solid (no stripes)**. The four color pairs work by setting the C register before ROM `$05C6` calls — the ROM's `CPL` in LD-EDGE-1 at `$05FB` toggles all bits, producing complementary color pairs. Solid mode copies the ROM byte reader to uncontended RAM via LDIR, patches absolute addresses for relocation, and replaces `OUT ($FE),A` with NOP NOP; a Color dropdown selects any of the 8 ZX Spectrum colors for the solid border. Setting is preserved in Save/Load project
- Improved **Cursor Loader** edit mode preview — unassigned cells now show a **dimmed grayscale** version of the source image with diagonal cross overlay, so the picture structure remains visible while placing cells. Previously unassigned cells showed only the paper color with crosses, making it hard to locate picture elements
- Fixed **Cursor Loader** tape stream desync — the direction handler left DE non-zero (E = direction × 2 from the dir_table lookup), causing ROM routine `$05C6` to enter multi-byte mode instead of reading single bytes. Only the first cell loaded correctly; all subsequent cells received wrong data. Fix: `LD DE, 0` before every `$05C6` call sequence. The ROM behavior: after reading one byte, `$05C6` checks DE at `$05BB` — if DE ≠ 0 it stores the byte at (IX), increments IX, decrements DE, and loops to read more bytes
- Plugin `patch()` can now return `null` to indicate the plugin handled its own output (no automatic download)

## v2.30
- Added **A/B comparison** to the image import dialog — two independent slots (A and B) let you compare different conversion settings side by side. View buttons (A, B, A+B) switch between single-slot and side-by-side preview. In A+B mode, click a preview panel to select it for editing. Each slot stores its own dithering, format, palette, adjustments, color strategy, and all other per-slot settings independently; crop, fit, and alignment are shared. A **Copy A→B** button duplicates the active slot's settings to the other slot. Slot previews are cached as ImageData for instant switching without re-conversion. Auto-labels below each preview summarize the active settings (e.g. "Floyd · SCR · Blend · blur:12 · C:+10"). Responsive layout: A+B stacks vertically when the dialog is narrow
- Fixed **ordered dither** (2×2, 4×4, 8×8) producing non-monotonic, chaotic patterns on cell-constrained formats (SCR, IFL, MLT, BMC4, ULA+, Gigascreen, etc.). Two issues: (1) the cell-level threshold used a non-linear color-distance ratio that distorted the Bayer pattern — replaced with linear projection of each pixel onto the ink–paper axis in RGB space, producing clean, regular ordered patterns matching reference implementations; (2) global ordered dither methods (`Ordered 4x4` etc.) applied full-image quantization then re-mapped pixels per cell, destroying the dither pattern — global ordered methods are now automatically remapped to cell-aware equivalents for all cell-constrained formats
- Fixed **SPECSCII brightness** when attributes are turned off — single-layer rendering used regular palette white (rgb 215,215,215) instead of bright white (rgb 255,255,255), causing SPECSCII to appear dimmer than SCR for the same picture. Now uses bright palette to match SCR
- Fixed **SCR → SPECSCII conversion** (Xform → Convert) losing original attributes on some cells — the glyph matcher tried both normal and inverted glyph patterns, and when an inverted match scored better it swapped ink/paper in the attribute byte. Now uses `specsciiInverseGrid` to store the inversion flag instead, preserving the original SCR attributes while keeping optimal glyph matching for maximum detail

## v2.29
- Added **Color Strategy** dropdown ("Pair fit") for image import — choose how ink/paper color pairs are selected per block. Three strategies: **Best fit** (exhaustive search using per-pixel nearest-color metric — the previous default), **Blend fit** (line-projection metric that measures perpendicular distance from each pixel to the ink–paper line segment, simulating dithering blend quality), and **PCA gradient** (PCA-guided candidate selection with line-projection evaluation — finds the dominant color axis via covariance matrix power iteration, then tests top palette matches near the axis extremes). Works with all ZX block sizes (8×8, 8×2, 8×1, 8×4) and ULA+. Hidden for non-ink/paper formats (NXI, SL2, LoRes). Disabled when mono mode is active
- Fixed **ordered dither** (4×4 and other matrix sizes) at cell level — was using luminance-only comparison to decide ink vs paper per pixel, producing incorrect color mapping. Now uses the same color-distance ratio approach as block-level dither: `inkRatio = paperDist / (inkDist + paperDist)` compared against Bayer threshold, matching the quality of the reference algorithm
- Improved **pre-blur performance** — replaced O(radius) per-pixel naive box kernel with O(1) running-sum algorithm (seed sum once per row/column, slide by adding entering pixel and subtracting leaving pixel). Eliminated per-cell Float32Array allocation by reusing module-level buffers that grow on demand
- Improved **disabled color indicator** in the palette strip — replaced the thin red diagonal line at reduced opacity with a bold white X cross with black drop-shadow at full color brightness, making disabled colors clearly marked while remaining readable

## v2.28
- Added **OkLab color space** for image import — new default color distance metric that produces more perceptually uniform results than CIE LAB, especially for blues and purples. The former LAB checkbox is now a **Colors** dropdown with three options: RGB, LAB, and OkLab (default). Uses Björn Ottosson's 2020 OkLab transform with cached conversions
- Added **Per-color palette disable** — clickable palette strip below the Palette dropdown shows all 16 ZX colors (8 regular + 8 bright). Click any swatch to disable it; disabled colors are dimmed with a red diagonal line and excluded from ink/paper pair search across all block sizes (8×8, 8×2, 8×1, 8×4) and from `findNearestColor`. Minimum 2 colors enforced. Strip resets on palette or format change. Hidden for non-ZX formats (ULA+, NXI, SL2, LoRes)
- Added **Pre-blur** slider (0–50) in the Transform section — blurs cell/block pixels before color pair selection to stabilize attribute colors on noisy or detailed images. Uses 3-pass separable box blur (Gaussian approximation) with edge clamping. The bitmap is always generated from original (unblurred) pixels, preserving sharp detail. Works with all ZX block sizes: 8×8 (SCR), 8×2 (IFL), 8×1 (MLT), 8×4 (BMC4)

## v2.27
- Fixed **color picker** not working for MLT+ULA+, LoRes, LoRes Radastan, BSP, and ZXP/chr$ formats — now works on all editable formats
- Moved **Grid controls** (Paper grid, Border grid, Grid color) from View Settings into their own collapsible **Grid** section — reduces clutter in View Settings and gives grid options their own expand/collapse state
- Added **LgK import** — `.scr.lgk` files (LgK v1.1rs compressed screens) can now be opened directly; decompression is automatic on load
- Fixed **LgK compressor** bug — sequential refs quick-fix path now correctly rebuilds mode costs, Huffman tables, XOR buffer, and attribute costs instead of using an incorrect arithmetic shortcut

## v2.26
- Moved **QR Code Generator** from Xform tab to **Tools** tab
- Moved **Display Filters** from View tab to **Tools** tab
- Added **?** help button to the Script Editor toolbar — opens an inline language reference overlay listing all commands, functions, operators, and control flow
- Added **credits section** to Help → About listing authors of third-party works used (ZX0, ZX7, UPKR, Laser Compact, ZXSC)
- Moved **Script Editor** to a resizable, draggable floating panel — open via the **Script Editor** link in the Tools tab. The panel can be dragged by its titlebar and resized from the bottom-right corner. Panel position and size are saved to localStorage and restored on reopen
- Added **`SL` namespace** for JS plugins — plugins now receive an `SL` object providing access to SpectraLab's compression modules: `SL.ZX0`, `SL.ZX7`, `SL.RLE`, `SL.ZXSC`, `SL.LC`, `SL.UPKR`. Each module exposes `compress()` and `decompress()` methods. Plugins can check availability with `if (SL.ZX0)` before use
- Updated **Maria's Christmas Box plugin** (`maria_sna.slpluginjs`) to use **RCS + ZX0** compression for save-back. RCS (Reverse Character Scan) reorders the bitmap for better compression before ZX0 packing. On save-back, the plugin injects the 112-byte `dzx0_smartRCS` depacker at `$FE90` (end of memory) — this decompresses ZX0 data and reverses RCS reordering on-the-fly directly to screen memory (no temp buffer needed). The data block (header + compressed screens at `$A000`) is kept portable for sideloading. User chooses ZX0 or RLE compression on save; a progress window with a progress bar shows per-screen compression sizes, free memory remaining, and a Cancel button to abort. ZX0 compressor, RCS reordering and `dzx0_smartRCS` depacker by Einar Saukas
- Added **Replace Picture…** button to the plugin session bar — quickly replaces the currently active picture with a `.scr` file without manual pixel editing. Useful for batch-replacing game screens from prepared artwork
- Plugin `patch()` functions can now return a **Promise** for async operations — the plugin manager awaits the result before downloading. Synchronous plugins continue to work unchanged

## v2.25
- Added **Script Tab** — embedded BASIC-style scripting engine for automating drawing, batch processing, and generative art. Supports variables, loops (`FOR`/`WHILE`/`REPEAT`), conditionals, user-defined functions, drawing and attribute commands, screen queries, and math functions. Scripts run asynchronously with a stop button; the entire script is a single undo step. Code editor with line numbers, Run/Stop controls, Load/Save (`.slscript`), output log, and 7 built-in example scripts. Script content auto-saved to localStorage between sessions
- Added **Test Suite** — custom HTML-based testing framework with 8 test suites covering attribute helpers, bitmap interleaving, compression codecs (ZX0, ZX7, RLE, ZXSC, LC, UPKR, Chunks), format detection, picture structure, format roundtrip (import/export for 13+ formats), utility functions, and editor operations (pixel drawing, undo/redo, layers, clipboard). Each suite runs in an isolated iframe with sequential execution and 60-second timeout. Open `tests/all-tests.html` in a browser to run

## v2.24
- Added **Canvas Rotation** — rotate the display by 0°, 90°, 180° or 270° via the **Rotate** dropdown next to Zoom in the View tab. Purely visual CSS rotation: all format renderers, load/save, PNG export, and data coordinates are unaffected. Mouse/drawing coordinates are inverse-mapped so tools work correctly at any rotation. The editor preview panel rotates to match. Rotation setting persists across sessions. Works with all formats including BSC, BMC4, and BSP border modes
- Included **Hero Quest 128K plugin** (`heroquest_128k.slpluginjs`) — extracts and patches 11 graphics from a 128K .sna snapshot across four RAM banks (3, 4, 6, 7). Ten 128×64 px graphics in banks 3/4/7 use non-standard linear layout (row-major bitmap + linear attributes) and are converted to/from ZX-interleaved SCR on the fly; bank 6 contains the full 256×192 playfield screen as a standard SCR. Unused screen area is filled with a bright/regular white attribute checkerboard to clearly mark the editable region

## v2.23
- Added **Plugin System** for custom format support — users can define plugins that extract and patch pictures from arbitrary binary files (e.g., game snapshots). Two plugin tiers: **JSON descriptors** (`.slplugin`) for simple offset-based extraction, and **JS plugins** (`.slpluginjs`) for complex formats with custom encode/decode logic
- **JSON descriptor plugins** support two address modes: `z80addr` (Z80 logical address with automatic bank mapping for .sna/.z80 snapshots) and `offset` (raw file byte offset for any binary). Supports bank override, hex/decimal addresses, post-patch byte fixups, and full save-back — edited pictures are patched into the original file at the correct addresses
- **JS plugins** provide `extract(fileBytes, snapshot)` and optional `patch(originalBytes, pictures, snapshot)` functions. The `snapshot` parameter exposes parsed bank arrays as zero-copy views for direct memory access. `jsSource` accepts an array of strings (one per line) for readable multi-line code in JSON
- **Plugin UI** in the Tools tab — Load, Open, Export, and Remove buttons. Plugins persist across sessions via localStorage. Plugin session bar appears for JSON descriptor plugins with Save Patched File / Save Raw / Close controls
- **Export via plugin** — any open picture can be exported through a JS plugin's `patch()` function, independent of plugin sessions. Useful for standalone codecs (e.g., RLE compression)
- Plugin descriptor files (`.slplugin`, `.slpluginjs`) can be installed by drag-and-drop or via the file input
- **JS plugins with sessions** — JS plugins can opt into session mode by setting `"session": true` in the descriptor. This enables the Save Patched File / Save Raw session bar, letting JS plugins extract pictures from a container file, edit them, and write them back — same workflow as JSON descriptor plugins, but with custom encode/decode logic
- Included example plugins: `example.slplugin` (SNA screen extraction), `example_js.slpluginjs` (JS extract/patch demo), `rle_scr.slpluginjs` (RLE-compressed SCR load/save), `maria_sna.slpluginjs` (Maria's Christmas Box — 5 RLE-packed screens + loading screen from 48K .sna, with cross-bank data handling and memory overflow protection)

## v2.22
- Added **Chunks compression** — lossy monochrome bitmap compression that divides 8×8 character cells into sub-chunks with a static 4-pattern dictionary (2 bits per chunk index). Two modes: **Chunks 4×4** (841 bytes total, fastest Z80 depacker) and **Chunks 4×2** (1573 bytes total, better quality). Color-aware density matching uses ink/paper luminance from original attributes for correct monochrome conversion. Supports user-defined explicit patterns and built-in presets. Available in the SCR export dropdown (`.scr.c4`, `.scr.c2`) and Compare Compressions dialog. Auto-decompressed on file open
- Added **Chunks** to the **Compare Compressions** dialog (⚙ Format settings checkbox). Both 4×4 and 4×2 variants shown for full SCR
- ASM export support for Chunks formats from the Compare Compressions dialog — uses `incbin` with offsets to extract lookup table, encoded data, and attributes from the binary file
- Added **Chunks 4×4 / Chunks 4×2 animated GIF import** — selecting Chunks 4×4 or Chunks 4×2 as the target format and importing a GIF as Animation now produces SCA type 2 with chunks compression. Each frame is converted to monochrome via Floyd-Steinberg dithering, then chunks-compressed. Per-frame data stores only the encoded bytes (768 bytes for 4×4, 1536 bytes for 4×2) — no codebook or lookup table per frame, since the standard preset dictionary is static
- Added **ASM export for Chunks SCA animations** — the SCA ASM (zip) export now supports type 2 chunks animations with a full Z80 player. The player embeds the static lookup table once and uses a fast depacker routine (DeChunks4x4 / DeChunks4x2) per frame. Targets both 48K and 128K machines (selects ROM 1 via port #7FFD at startup for correct IM 1 interrupt handling)
- Added **partial region support for Chunks SCA** — Chunks 4×4 / 4×2 animations can now target any screen region (top/middle/bottom third, top+middle, middle+bottom, or full screen). The region dropdown is enabled in the SCA save dialog when using chunks compression. Encoded data size scales with the region (256/512/768 bytes for 4×4, 512/1024/1536 bytes for 4×2). The Z80 depacker accepts the thirds count as a parameter

## v2.21
- Added **ZXSC (LZF) compression** — modified LZF (LZ77 family) compressor with optimal DP parsing, based on [ZXSC by TomDDG](https://github.com/TomDDG/ZXSC---ZX-Spectrum-Screen-Compresser). Two variants: standard linear (49-byte depacker) and screen-scan with non-linear cell-order reordering (80-byte depacker) for visually pleasing decompression. Available in the SCR export dropdown (`.scr.lzf`) and Compare Compressions dialog
- Added **RLE** and **ZXSC** to the **Compare Compressions** dialog (⚙ Format settings checkboxes). ZXSC screen-scan variant only shown for full SCR
- Added **RLE** (`.scr.rle`) and **ZXSC** (`.scr.lzf`, `.scr.lzf screen-scan`) to the **SCR Export** dropdown
- ASM export support for RLE and ZXSC from the Compare Compressions dialog
- SCR export dropdown items sorted alphabetically

## v2.20
- Added **RLE compression** — PackBits-style codec optimized for fast Z80 decompression (~23-byte depacker, LDIR for literals at 21 T/byte, DJNZ for repeats at 26 T/byte). Uses backward-pass dynamic programming for provably optimal encoding. Available in the SCA type 2 save
- Added **SCA type 2 compression options** — the SCA save dialog now offers three compression options for type 2 animations: ZX0, Laser Compact, and RLE

## v2.19
- Added **GIF frame navigation** to the import dialog — when opening a multi-frame animated GIF, ◄/► buttons and a slider appear next to the mode dropdown, allowing you to preview any individual frame with the current format, dithering, and adjustment settings before importing. The Animation import mode still imports all frames regardless of which frame is previewed
- Added **Grid checkbox** to the source (ORIGINAL) canvas in the import dialog — overlays an 8×8 pixel grid within the crop rectangle, showing character cell boundaries in source image coordinates
- Added **ASM (zip) export** to the SCA editor — exports a ZIP containing the trimmed `.sca` file and a `.asm` sjasmplus source with a ready-to-assemble SCA animation player. Supports both type 0 (full 6912-byte frames) and type 1 (attr-only with fill pattern). The player uses HALT-based timing, IM 1 interrupts, and produces a `.sna` snapshot via SAVESNA

## v2.18
- Fixed animated GIF import ignoring format selection — importing as SCA animation with format set to 53c (attr-only) now correctly creates SCA type 1 (attribute-only frames with fill pattern) instead of always producing type 0 (full frames)
- Added "Custom" option to the 53c pattern selector in the image import dialog — enter any 8-byte fill pattern as hex (e.g. `0F 0F 0F 0F F0 F0 F0 F0`). Works for both single-image 53c import and animated GIF→SCA type 1 import
- Improved 53c/127c image import quality — added cell-level Floyd-Steinberg error diffusion so color quantization errors are spread to neighboring cells, reducing blocky color clash artifacts. Enabled by default via a "Diffusion" checkbox next to the pattern selector; uncheck to use the old per-cell-independent algorithm. Applies to both single-image 53c import and animated GIF→SCA type 1 conversion

## v2.17
- Fixed pixel edits lost on undo/save for NXI, SL2, LoRes, and LoRes Radastan formats — drawing on the background layer now correctly syncs layer data, so undo reverts only the last action and edits are preserved across save/load
- Fixed background layer desync for cell fill, cell invert, recolor, paste, selection invert, attribute optimize, and hidden pixel removal across all bitmap formats (SCR, BSC, IFL, MLT, BMC4, GMX, Gigascreen) — these operations now keep layer data in sync with screenData, preventing undo from reverting all changes at once
- Fixed very slow freehand drawing on non-background layers for NXI, SL2, LoRes, and LoRes Radastan formats — `flattenLayersToScreen()` was called per pixel (25+ times per brush stamp for brush size 5), now deferred to once per frame via `scheduleRender()`. Same fix applied to transparent-color painting on non-background layers for all bitmap formats. Also cached `ImageData`, pre-computed 32-bit palette for single-write-per-pixel NXI rendering, and reused the compositing buffer to eliminate per-frame allocations

## v2.16
- Fixed SCA filmstrip scrolling — selecting a frame no longer jumps the page to the top; only the filmstrip scrolls when the selected frame is off-screen
- Marked SCA frames (trimmed, manually deleted, duplicate) now show tooltips explaining their status and that they will be excluded from the saved file
- Fix merge artifacts: duplicate help file entries for Monochrome export formats, LC/upkr compression, Create ASM, and file format table rows

## v2.15
- **Faster import preview during slider drags** — dragging brightness, contrast, saturation, gamma, sharpness, smoothing, levels, color balance, or dither strength sliders now skips multi-pass dither-region compositing and uses throttled debounce (150 ms). Full-quality render with all dither regions runs on slider release. Switching the **Show** dropdown (Source/Preview/Both/None) no longer triggers a full re-conversion — only the overlay is repainted from cache.
- Double-click now reliably closes a dither region lasso polygon (minimum 2 vertices)

## v2.14
- **Dither Regions** — draw lasso regions on the source or preview canvas during image import to assign different dithering algorithms to different areas. Up to 3 color-coded regions (red, green, blue), each with its own dithering method dropdown and **strength slider** (0–100%). Switch to the **Dither** tab to enable lasso drawing (Image tab is for crop, Adjustments tab is for color/levels). Click to place polygon vertices, double-click or click near the first vertex to close. Right-click or Escape to cancel. Erase mode and Clear All button to manage regions. Show overlay on Source, Preview, Both, or None. Last used dithering methods and strengths are saved to localStorage (defaults: Floyd-Steinberg, Ordered 2×2, Riemersma; all 100%). Supported for cell-based formats (SCR, IFL, MLT, BSC, BMC4, RGB3, Gigascreen/MG, GMX 640, ULA+, MLT+ULA+, ZXP ULA+) and pixel-based formats (NXI 256, NXI 320, NXI 640, SL2 256, SL2 320, SL2 640, LoRes, LoRes RAD). Multi-pass conversion runs each unique dithering method+strength combination separately and composites results per cell or per pixel using the region mask. Tooltip hints added to all dither region controls.
- Fixed all global dithering methods (Jarvis, Stucki, Burkes, Sierra, Atkinson, Riemersma, Blue Noise, Pattern, A-Dither, Noise, etc.) producing identical Floyd-Steinberg output for NXI 320/640, SL2 320/640, LoRes, and LoRes RAD formats — `quantizeNextPixelsExt` had hardcoded Floyd-Steinberg error diffusion for all non-ordered methods instead of dispatching to the correct algorithm
- Fixed ULA+ and ZXP ULA+ formats not supporting global dithering methods at all — non-cell-aware methods fell back to nearest-color mapping with no dithering. Now applies `applyGlobalDither` before cell processing, matching the approach used by all other cell-based formats
- Fixed dither region import compositing producing vertical stripe artifacts on NXI 320 and SL2 320 formats — byte offset calculation assumed row-major storage but these formats use column-major pixel order (`address = x × 256 + y`)

## v2.13
- Fixed GMX 160×200 import preview displaying at wrong aspect ratio — was 320×400 (too narrow). Now displays at 640×400 (pixels doubled horizontally), matching GMX 640×200 display and real hardware output

## v2.12
- Fixed import preview grid not covering full canvas for formats with doubled rows (GMX 640×200, GMX 160×200, NXI 640×256, SL2 640×256)
- Fixed SL2 640×256 import producing near-blue image — was quantizing to the first 16 entries of the RGB332 identity palette (mostly blues). Now uses optimized palette (16 most frequent RGB333 colors from the image)

## v2.11
- Fixed import preview grid only covering 256×192 area for non-SCR formats (SL2, GMX, BSC, etc.) — grid now covers the full format dimensions
- Fixed BSC/BSP/BMC4 border conversion producing strokes shorter than 24px (hardware minimum). Interior runs in top/bottom/side borders now enforce the 3-segment (24px) minimum, matching real ZX Spectrum timing (12 T-states per OUT to port $FE)
- Added paper area rectangle overlay in BSC/BSP/BMC4 import preview grid
- Fixed ordered dithering (2×2, 4×4, 8×8) not working for NXI/SL2/LoRes formats — Bayer threshold was never applied, and strength slider had no effect. Also fixed strength slider not scaling Floyd-Steinberg error diffusion for these formats
- Fixed NXI/SL2/LoRes non-FS error diffusion methods (Atkinson, Sierra-2, Serpentine, Riemersma, Blue Noise, Pattern) silently falling through to Floyd-Steinberg — replaced inline dithering with unified `applyGlobalDither` dispatch
- Fixed BMC4 cell-aware dithering completely broken — all methods mapped to "none" (no dithering). Now correctly dispatches all 10 cell dither methods
- Fixed IFL cell-aware dithering missing most methods — only Floyd-Steinberg and Ordered 4×4 worked, other 8 methods fell through to "none". All methods now supported
- Added Ordered 2×2 and Ordered 8×8 cell-aware dithering to all formats (SCR, MLT, Gigascreen, IFL, BMC4, GMX, ULA+, ZXP)
- Fixed dither strength slider having no effect on cell-aware dithering — all cell/block dither functions (Floyd-Steinberg, Atkinson, Sierra-2, Serpentine, Riemersma, Ordered, Blue Noise, Pattern) now respect the strength parameter
- Added attribute-level dithering for GMX 160×200 format — all dithering methods now work on the 160×200 half-cell color grid, improving gradient and color transition quality
- Fixed RAD 128×96 (16c) import using wrong palette — the first 16 entries of RGB332 only contain dark blue/green shades with no reds or bright colors. Now uses optimized palette (16 most frequent RGB333 colors from the image) and embeds the 32-byte palette in the output .rad file
- Widened Format and Palette dropdowns in import dialog to prevent label clipping
- Moved zoom/grid controls to the top header area of each canvas in the import dialog — source image has its own zoom (x1–x4), preview has zoom (x1–x5) and grid toggle. Both canvases now support scrollbars when zoomed image exceeds the available space
- Added "Fit" option to import dialog zoom controls — source defaults to Fit (scales to fill available space up to x2), preview defaults to x2
- Fixed "Mono output" checkbox not working for most formats — Gigascreen/MG, HLR, STL, RGB3, ULA+, GMX 160×200, 53c, Specscii, NXI, SL2, LoRes, and LoRes RAD now correctly produce monochrome (black & white) output when the checkbox is checked
- Reorganized import dialog layout — moved LAB colors/Grayscale/Mono output checkboxes into the Source group; fixed Image/Adjustments tab highlight being inverted

## v2.10
- **Dither Brush tool (W)** — re-dither individual cells or regions with a different dithering algorithm. After importing an image, source pixels are stored automatically; select the Dither Brush tool and paint over cells to apply a new method (Floyd-Steinberg, Atkinson, Ordered 4x4, Sierra-2, Serpentine, Riemersma, Blue Noise, Pattern, None). Round pixel-accurate brush with diameter 3–16 px, strength slider. Use **Shift+W** or the ▩ button to re-dither the current selection at once.
- Fixed SCA files created from animated GIF import having version 0 in the header instead of version 1, which made them unplayable in external players

## v2.9
- **Ellipse drawing** — new `Ellip` and `EllipF` toolbar buttons for ellipse outline and fill. Four new opcodes: `ellipse_outline_abs cx, cy, rx, ry` (0x89), `ellipse_fill_abs cx, cy, rx, ry` (0x8A), `ellipse_outline_chain rx, ry` (0x8B), `ellipse_fill_chain rx, ry` (0x8C). Centre coordinates are 7-bit logical (0–127), radii are 8-bit unsigned. JS VM uses midpoint ellipse algorithm with 4-way symmetry; fill variant pre-computes per-scanline half-widths to avoid XOR artifacts. Full assembler/disassembler roundtrip, nudge support for `_abs` variants, and rubber-band overlay preview.
- **`ZGS_USE_ELLIPSES` conditional flag** — new conditional compilation flag (~800 bytes) for ellipse outline/fill opcodes (0x89–0x8C). Auto-detected from scene content like text flags. Z80 ASM player includes full midpoint ellipse routines with 16-bit arithmetic for error terms, 4-way symmetry point plotting, and span-based fill via `draw_hspan`. IFDEF-guarded with stub handlers when disabled.
- **Shape modifier keys** — hold modifier keys while dragging to constrain shapes:
  - **Ctrl** — constrain to 1:1 ratio (square for Rect/RectF, circle for Ellip/EllipF)
  - **Alt** — draw from center instead of corner
  - **Ctrl+Alt** — both combined
  - Applies to: Rect, RectF, Circle, CircleF, Ellip, EllipF. Modifiers update the rubber-band preview in real-time.
- **Zoom x4/x5** — preview canvas zoom selector now includes x4 and x5 options in addition to x1/x2/x3.
- Fixed flood fill in Z80 ASM player corrupting pattern fills: rewritten to use a column-level visited bitmap (768 bytes) instead of relying on the screen buffer as a visited marker. The old two-phase approach (solid 0xFF fill, then pattern mask) failed to apply patterns to edge bytes of spans. Now matches `viewer.asm` approach: pattern is applied directly during fill, visited bitmap prevents re-entering filled columns. `ZGS_USE_FLOOD` size updated to ~2300 bytes (512-byte stack + 768-byte visited bitmap).
- Fixed `wait_key` blocking preview rendering: instant render now skips `wait_key` so all drawing commands after it are visible. During animated playback (Play button), `wait_key` properly pauses and waits for a keypress or canvas click before continuing.
- Default playback speed increased by 25% (50ms → 37ms per step).
- Fixed animated GIF import ignoring crop/fit settings from the import dialog — fill/crop mode was stretching the full image to 256×192 instead of cropping. Now captures crop, fit mode, offset, size, and alignment before closing the dialog and applies them to each frame via an offscreen canvas. Same fix applied to flash GIF import.
- Fixed animated GIF SCR conversion producing wrong colors — replaced the broken "two most frequent colors + brightness group merge" heuristic with a brute-force optimal search over all 128 ink/paper/brightness combinations per cell (same algorithm as the standard image import). The old code had operator precedence bugs in brightness merging and could assign arbitrary wrong colors when the two most frequent colors came from different brightness groups.

## v2.8
- **Nudge selection with Alt+Arrows** — select lines in the source textarea and press Alt+Arrow keys to shift absolute coordinates by ±1 logical unit. Coordinates clamped to 0–127. Undoable with Ctrl+Z:
  - All `_abs` instructions: `move_abs`, `dot_abs`, `hline_abs`, `vline_abs`, `rect_outline_abs`, `rect_fill_abs`, `circle_outline_abs`, `circle_fill_abs`, `flood_abs`, `stamp_abs`
  - Batch/polygon instructions: `dot_batch`, `rect_outline_batch`, `rect_fill_batch`, `polygon_outline`, `polygon_fill`
  - Relative/delta instructions, comments, and non-coordinate lines are left untouched
- **Reference image overlay** — per-scene reference image for tracing/drawing. Load any image file, adjust opacity (5–80%), position (X/Y offset), and display size (W/H, auto defaults to 256×192). Each scene stores its own reference image and settings independently. New scenes inherit the current scene's reference image. Collapsible UI panel below playback controls; panel state persists via localStorage.
- **Project format v2 (.zgp)** — `.zgp` files now save reference images with deduplication: shared images are stored once in a `referenceImages` array, scenes reference by index. Backward-compatible — v1 `.zgp` files load normally (scenes have no reference).
- **Smart New button** — the New button now adds a new blank scene tab when the project has existing content (loaded or edited scenes). Resets the whole project only when all scenes are still empty/default.
- Fixed Ctrl+Z / Ctrl+Y (undo/redo) not working when a non-English keyboard layout is active (e.g. Russian). Shortcuts now use physical key codes instead of character values.

## v2.7
- Fixed ZGS disassembler producing duplicate `end` commands when loading a .zgs file that was previously saved (assembler unconditionally appended a second END opcode; disassembler parsed all bytes past the first END). Assembler now only appends END if not already present; disassembler stops at the first END opcode.
- **NXI → SL2 palette handling** — converting NXI to SL2 now shows a dialog when the palette differs from the default RGB332, offering three options: **Keep palette** (embed palette after pixel data in the SL2 file), **Quantize to default** (remap pixel indices to the closest default RGB332 colors), or **Strip palette** (remove palette, keep pixel indices unchanged for use with an external palette file). When the palette matches the default, conversion proceeds silently as before.
- **SL2 save with palette** — saving an SL2 file with a non-default palette now automatically embeds the palette after pixel data (producing 49664/82432/81952-byte files), instead of warning about palette loss. Files with the default palette are saved as raw pixels only.

## v2.6
- Fixed `zgs_clear_screen` corrupting last bitmap byte (bottom-right cell) with the attribute value
- Fixed flood fill in Z80 ASM player: rewritten with two-phase approach (solid fill, then pattern mask); removed 768-byte visited bitmap
- Fixed scenes not always terminated with END opcode, causing Z80 VM to read past scene data into garbage
- Fixed `show_from_addr`/`show_by_num` jumping to undefined address after `zgs_wait_key` returns; now halts properly
- Fixed opening .zgs/.zgt file not setting project name, causing ASM export to propose "untitled.zip"
- **42-col and 64-col text modes** — new text printing modes with narrower character widths: 42 chars/line (6px wide) and 64 chars/line (4px wide). Six new opcodes: `set_cursor_42 col, row` (0x83), `print_text_42 "str"` (0x84), `print_packed_42 "str"` (0x85), `set_cursor_64 col, row` (0x86), `print_text_64 "str"` (0x87), `print_packed_64 "str"` (0x88). Each mode has independent cursor position tracking. Two new DEFINE flags: `ZGS_USE_TEXT_42` (~200 bytes + 768-byte font), `ZGS_USE_TEXT_64` (~200 bytes + 768-byte font). Config block updated: `zgs_font_42_addr` at ORG+0x14, `zgs_font_64_addr` at ORG+0x16, `scene_count` shifted to ORG+0x18, `scene_table` to ORG+0x19. Text mode dropdown added to ZGS Editor text toolbar (32/42/64 selection). 4×8 and 6×8 fonts are derived from the 8×8 ROM font: 6×8 uses top 6 bits (mask 0xFC), 4×8 is generated by OR-ing column pairs (bit[n] = bit[2n] | bit[2n+1]).
- **Separate font binaries for ASM export** — fonts are now exported as separate binary files included via `incbin` instead of inline `db` data. Three font files: `font_8x8.bin` (standard 8×8 ROM font for 32-col), `font_6x8.bin` (6-pixel-wide font for 42-col), `font_4x8.bin` (4-pixel-wide condensed font for 64-col). Each is 768 bytes (96 chars × 8 bytes). Users can replace any font binary with a custom design for each text mode independently. All three files are included in the ZIP export alongside the `.asm` and `.zgs` files.
- **Auto-detection of text DEFINE flags** — `ZGS_USE_TEXT`, `ZGS_USE_TEXT_42`, and `ZGS_USE_TEXT_64` are now automatically enabled/disabled based on which text opcodes appear in the scene source. Font binaries are IFDEF-guarded: `font_8x8.bin` is only included when `ZGS_USE_TEXT` is defined, `font_6x8.bin` when `ZGS_USE_TEXT_42`, `font_4x8.bin` when `ZGS_USE_TEXT_64`. Scenes that don't use text save up to 2304 bytes of font data.
- **42/64-col support in viewer.asm** — the standalone Z80 viewer now includes full 42-col and 64-col text rendering: cross-byte 6px renderer for 42-col, nibble-based 4px renderer for 64-col, refactored packed text with SMC dispatch for all three modes. Font binaries loaded via `incbin`, all IFDEF-guarded.
- **42/64-col support in zgsvm.py** — the Python pygame-based viewer now supports all six new text opcodes (0x83–0x88) with correct font rendering and independent cursor tracking per mode.

## v2.5
- **Multi-scene ZGS projects** — the ZGS Editor now supports multiple scenes in a single project. A tabbed interface allows creating, switching, renaming, and deleting scenes. Each scene has its own source text, undo/redo history, and compiled binary. Add scenes with the + button; double-click a tab to rename; close button removes a scene (minimum 1).
- **Project save/load (.zgp)** — save and restore multi-scene projects as `.zgp` files (JSON format). Preserves all scene names, source text, and the active scene index. Open `.zgp` files via the Open button or drag-and-drop.
- **New ASM config block** — the exported Z80 assembly now features a 4-JP entry point config block at fixed addresses: `show_from_addr` (ORG+0x00), `show_by_num` (ORG+0x03), `zgs_clear_screen` (ORG+0x06), `zgs_wait_key` (ORG+0x09). Followed by patchable config fields: `zgs_font_addr` (ORG+0x0C), `zgs_scene_addr` (ORG+0x0E), `zgs_dict_addr` (ORG+0x10), `scene_num` (ORG+0x12), `clear_color` (ORG+0x13), `scene_count` (ORG+0x14), and `scene_table` (ORG+0x15). The `show_by_num` routine looks up a scene address from the table by index, enabling programmatic scene selection.
- **Clear screen with color** — `zgs_clear_screen` now reads the `clear_color` config field instead of always clearing to black. Bitmap bytes are set to 0, attribute bytes are filled with the `clear_color` value. This applies to both the JS ASM player library and `viewer.asm`.
- **ZIP export** — ASM export now packages all files into a single `.zip` download via JSZip: the `.asm` file, all compiled `.zgs` scene binaries, and the packed text dictionary (`.zdict`). Falls back to individual file downloads if JSZip is unavailable.
- **Dict serializer** — new `zgsSerializeDictBinary()` function serializes a dictionary object to the `.zdict` binary format (inverse of `zgsLoadZdict()`), used for ZIP export.
- **Save dropdown** — the Save button is now a single dropdown menu offering four formats: Save .zgs (binary), Save .zgt (text), Save .zgp (project), and Export .asm (assembly+ZIP).
- **Open into new tab** — opening a `.zgs` or `.zgt` file creates a new scene tab instead of replacing the current one. Empty scenes or scenes with default example text are replaced in-place.
- Fixed canvas rendering artifacts (non-uniform pattern lines) caused by the global `box-sizing: border-box` rule interacting with the canvas border.
- `viewer.asm` updated with the same 4-JP config block, `show_from_addr`/`show_by_num` routines, and `clear_color`-aware `zgs_clear_screen`. Text overlay config fields removed (handled via ZGS opcodes).

## v2.4
- **Conditional compilation for ZGS ASM player** — the exported Z80 assembly now includes `IFDEF`-based feature selection. Eight `DEFINE` flags control which opcode groups are compiled in. Comment out unused DEFINEs to reduce the binary size. When a feature is disabled, its handler labels collapse to `or 1 : ret` stubs, and all exclusive subroutines, data tables, and variables are excluded. Approximate byte savings per feature: `ZGS_USE_LINES` ~443, `ZGS_USE_RECTS` ~636, `ZGS_USE_CIRCLES` ~612, `ZGS_USE_POLYGONS` ~666, `ZGS_USE_FLOOD` ~2300 (includes 512-byte stack + 768-byte visited bitmap), `ZGS_USE_TEXT` ~180, `ZGS_USE_PACKED_TEXT` ~724 (includes ~520 byte dictionary), `ZGS_USE_STAMPS` ~146. When only text features are defined and all drawing features are disabled, the coordinate system (dot/move handlers, `plot_pixel`, math helpers, pattern/mask tables) is automatically excluded via the auto-derived `ZGS_HAS_DRAWING` flag. Dependencies: `ZGS_USE_PACKED_TEXT` requires `ZGS_USE_TEXT`; rect/polygon outlines require `ZGS_USE_LINES`.

## v2.3
- **Text opcodes** — two new ZGS opcodes for rendering text using the ZX Spectrum ROM font (8×8, characters 32–127):
  - `set_cursor col, row` (0x80) — set the text cursor to character cell coordinates (col 0–31, row 0–23)
  - `print_text "string"` (0x81) — print ASCII text at the cursor position using the current attribute; cursor advances after each character and wraps at column 32
  - `print_packed "string"` (0x82) — dictionary-compressed text, 30–50% smaller than `print_text` for English prose. Uses a three-tier encoding: word tokens (codes 1–31), literal ASCII (32–127), bigram tokens (128–223), and trigram tokens (224–255). Dictionary is external (.zdict format) with built-in lowercase/uppercase English variants, plus custom user dictionaries loaded from `.zdict` files. `.dict` directive selects the encoding dictionary (`lower`, `upper`, or `user`).
- **Text drawing tool** — new Text tool in the ZGS Editor shape toolbar. Click the canvas to place a `set_cursor` command at the clicked character cell. Type text in the toolbar input and click Print to insert a `print_text` command. Cursor placement and text insertion are separate operations, allowing interleaved drawing between text commands.
- **ROM font embedded** — the standard ZX Spectrum ROM font (768 bytes, 96 characters) is embedded in both the JS VM and the Z80 ASM player. The Z80 player uses the ROM address `0x3D00` by default, configurable via the `zgs_font_addr` variable.
- **ASM export restructured** — the exported Z80 assembly now uses a poke-friendly `jr start` config block at the top with `zgs_font_addr` and `zgs_scene_addr` at fixed addresses. Removed `di` and `ld sp` instructions for BASIC compatibility.
- Z80 ASM player: text cursor state, `op_set_cursor` and `op_print_text` handlers with full ZX Spectrum screen address calculation, SET/XOR draw mode support, and attribute setting.
- ZGS format specification updated with text opcodes (0x80, 0x81) and text mnemonics (`set_cursor`, `print_text`).
- Showcase example updated with text printing demo.

## v2.2
- **Grid overlay** — Grid checkbox in the controls bar shows an 8×8 character cell grid (subtle orange lines) over the preview canvas with brighter screen third separators at y=64/128. Persists via localStorage.
- **Theme toggle** — moon/sun button (☾/☀) in the header bar toggles light/dark theme, synced with main SpectraLab and Font Editor via the shared `spectraLabTheme` localStorage key.

## v2.1
- **Save .asm** — export a complete sjasmplus Z80 assembly file containing the ZGS player library (`zgs_draw`, `zgs_clear_screen`, `zgs_wait_key`) and the current scene as `incbin`. Downloads both `.asm` and `.zgs` files; assemble with `sjasmplus` to produce a working `.sna` snapshot. The player library is a self-contained Z80 VM that renders ZGS bytecode directly to ZX Spectrum screen memory.
- **Polyline drawing** — right-drag with the Line tool to draw multi-segment polylines. After the first segment is committed, a rubber band continuously tracks the mouse from the last endpoint. Right-click/drag again to add more segments. Left click or Escape to finish.
- Command toolbar dropdowns (Ink, Paper, Pattern) now show the currently selected value in the dropdown label (e.g., "Ink: red", "Paper: blue", "Pat: checker").
- ZGS player (`viewer.asm`): restructured with a clean public API — `zgs_draw(HL)` entry point that accepts a ZGS binary address, resets VM state, and renders the scene. New `zgs_base` variable replaces hardcoded `scene_data` references in `parse_header`. Labels renamed: `clear_screen` → `zgs_clear_screen`, `wait_key` → `zgs_wait_key`.

## v2.0
- ZGS Editor — standalone tool (`zgs_editor.html`) for editing ZGS (ZX Graphics Script) vector scenes. Features a text editor for `.zgt` assembly with live preview, assembler (text→binary), disassembler (binary→text), and a full bytecode VM (256×192 pixel buffer, 32×24 attribute cells, 35 opcodes: lines, rectangles, circles, polygons, flood fill, pattern fills, sprites, repeat loops, subroutine calls, LZ decompression). Open `.zgs` binary files (auto-disassembled to text) or `.zgt` text files. Auto-render with 500ms debounce, animated step-by-step playback with adjustable speed, save as `.zgs` (binary) or `.zgt` (text). Drag-and-drop file support. Zoom selector (x1/x2/x3) with localStorage persistence. Accessible via **ZGS Editor** link in the Tools tab.
- XOR draw mode — `set_mode xor` / `set_mode set` instruction (opcode `0x1B`) toggles pixels instead of always setting them. Useful for blinking highlights and cursor animation in adventure game UIs.
- Disassembler now emits version number in the header comment (`; ZGS text format v1`).
- Interactive canvas — hover over the preview canvas to see logical coordinates (tooltip + status bar). Right-click or left-click with the Cursor tool to copy coordinates to clipboard.
- Shape drawing tools — Dot, Line, Rect, RectF, Circle, CircleF, Flood, ClearR. Select a tool from the toolbar and click/drag on the canvas to draw. The generated ZGS instruction is inserted before the `end` statement and the preview re-renders instantly. Rubber-band overlay shows shape preview during drag. ClearR snaps to the 8×8 character cell grid.
- Command toolbar — dropdown selects for Ink, Paper (with Bright checkbox), and Pattern insert `set_ink`, `set_paper`, `set_pattern` commands. Buttons for XOR, SET, Clear, WaitKey, End insert the corresponding instructions.
- Pen crosshair — semi-transparent green crosshair on the overlay canvas shows the VM pen position after render/step/play. Toggle with the Pen checkbox.
- Source line sync — during Step playback, the corresponding source line is highlighted in the textarea. Built on an assembler source map that tracks byte offsets to line numbers.
- Assembler now stops parsing after scene-level `end`, so trailing text (comments, notes) does not cause errors.

## v1.100
- Cell Invert tool: right-click inverts all cells on the screen that share the same attribute as the clicked cell. Left-click retains existing single-cell behavior with drag support.

## v1.99
- upkr compression — built-in upkr (rANS entropy coding) compression for SCR format with Z80-optimized settings. Export dropdown adds `.scr.upk (upkr level 1)` and `.scr.upk (upkr level 9)`. The **Compare compressions...** dialog includes two upkr rows (level 1 and level 9) with depacker size 450 bytes (130 code + 320 probs array). **Create ASM** generates a sjasmplus example with the upkr Z80 unpacker by Peter "Ped" Helcmanovsky. Open `.scr.upk` files directly — decompression is automatic on load.
- Compression Compare dialog: the dialog now stays open after saving, allowing multiple formats to be exported without re-running compression.
- Compression Compare dialog: format settings (⚙ gear icon) — enable/disable individual format families (ZX7, ZX0, RCS, LC, upkr) and choose depacker variant (upkr compact 450B vs fast 475B). Settings persist in localStorage across sessions.

## v1.98
- LC compression — built-in Laser Compact 5.2.1 compression for SCR format. Export dropdown adds `.scr.lc (LC compressed)`. The **Compare compressions...** dialog now includes an LC row alongside ZX7/ZX0 variants, using `compressScreen` with native segment support (start/end/attrs options map to the Data+Segment selections). **Create ASM** generates a sjasmplus example with the Laser Compact 5.2 depacker by Hrumer that decompresses LCMP5 data directly to screen memory. Open `.scr.lc` files directly — decompression is automatic on load.
- Compression Compare dialog: two new columns — **Depacker** shows the Z80 depacker size in bytes (ZX7=69, ZX0=68–69, RCS+ZX7=110, RCS+ZX0=112–113 using [smart integrated decoders](https://github.com/einar-saukas/RCS) with no temp buffer, LC=209), **Total** shows real saving (saved bytes minus depacker overhead). Negative totals (compression+depacker larger than original) are highlighted in red.

## v1.97
- Compression Compare dialog: estimates now run on demand — click the **Compare** button to start compression (the dialog no longer auto-compresses on open). Two new checkboxes: **Clean hidden cells** and **Optimize attributes** apply pre-compression optimizations to a temporary working copy before comparing, without affecting the original image or undo history.
- Compression Compare dialog: new **Data** and **Segment** options. Data mode selects between Full SCR (6912 bytes, bitmap+attributes) and Bitmap only (6144 bytes). When Bitmap only is selected, the Segment dropdown lets you compare individual thirds (2048 bytes each), pairs of thirds (4096 bytes), or the whole bitmap. RCS variants are only shown for whole-segment modes; segment slices show plain + ZX7/ZX0 forward/backward only. ASM generation is available only for Full SCR + Whole mode.
- Monochrome bitmap loading: when opening a monochrome file (full, 2/3, or 1/3) and the current editor ink and paper colors are identical, ink is automatically adjusted so the bitmap is visible (white on black if paper is black, black otherwise).

## v1.96
- Palette sort by usage for NXI/SL2/LoRes formats — "Sort by usage" button in the Next palette section reorders palette entries so that used colors come first (sorted by pixel frequency, descending), followed by unused colors. Pixel indices are automatically remapped so the image remains visually identical. Undoable with Ctrl+Z.
- Fix: creating a new NXI/SL2/LoRes picture no longer overwrites the palette of the previously loaded picture.

## v1.95
- ZX0 compression — built-in [ZX0](https://github.com/einar-saukas/ZX0) compression (v2 format) by Einar Saukas for SCR format. Export dropdown adds `.scr.zx0` (ZX0 compressed) and `.rcs.zx0` (RCS reordered + ZX0 compressed). The **Compare compressions...** dialog now shows all nine variants (plain SCR, ZX7/ZX0 forward/backward, RCS+ZX7/ZX0 forward/backward) side-by-side with compressed sizes, bytes saved, and ratios, highlights the smallest result, and lets you save the selected variant. Backward variants use `.zx0b` extension (`.scr.zx0b`, `.rcs.zx0b`). **Create ASM** checkbox generates a ready-to-assemble sjasmplus example that decompresses the file directly to screen memory (includes the appropriate ZX7 or ZX0 decompressor and RCS reorder routine where needed, uses `device zxspectrum48` and `savesna`). Open `.scr.zx0`/`.scr.zx0b` and `.rcs.zx0`/`.rcs.zx0b` files directly — decompression (and RCS reordering reversal) is automatic on load.

## v1.94
- ZX7 compression — built-in [ZX7](https://spectrumcomputing.co.uk/entry/27996/ZX-Spectrum/ZX7) compression by Einar Saukas for SCR format. Export dropdown adds three options: `.scr.zx7` (ZX7 compressed), `.rcs.zx7` (RCS reordered + ZX7 compressed), and **Compare compressions...** dialog. The compare dialog shows five variants side-by-side (plain SCR, ZX7, ZX7 backwards, RCS+ZX7, RCS+ZX7 backwards) with compressed sizes, bytes saved, and ratios, highlights the smallest result, and lets you save the selected variant. Backward variants use `.zx7b` extension (`.scr.zx7b`, `.rcs.zx7b`). **Create ASM** checkbox generates a ready-to-assemble sjasmplus example that decompresses the file directly to screen memory (includes ZX7 decompressor and RCS reorder routine where needed, uses `device zxspectrum48` and `savesna`). Open `.scr.zx7`/`.scr.zx7b` and `.rcs.zx7`/`.rcs.zx7b` files directly — decompression (and RCS reordering reversal) is automatic on load.

## v1.93
- RCS format support — import and export [RCS (Re-ordered Compressed Screen)](https://github.com/einar-saukas/RCS) files by Einar Saukas. RCS reorders the 6144 bitmap bytes using S→C→R→L nesting for better compression ratios; attributes are unchanged. Export via the Export dropdown when an SCR file is loaded (6912-byte `.rcs` output). Open `.rcs` files directly — reordering is automatically reversed on load, converting back to standard SCR for viewing and editing.
- Clean Hidden Cells — new tool in the Xform tab. For cells where ink equals paper but the bitmap contains a non-trivial pattern (not all-0x00 or all-0xFF), sets all bitmap bytes to 0x00 or 0xFF based on neighbor cells' bitmap density. If the majority of bits in the four adjacent cells (up/down/left/right) are set, the hidden cell is filled with 0xFF; otherwise with 0x00. Available for all formats with both bitmap and attributes: SCR, BSC, IFL, MLT, BMC4, GMX, Gigascreen, ULA+. Hidden for attribute-only formats (GMX 160, HLR, 53c, STL, SPECSCII) and formats without attributes. Undoable with Ctrl+Z. The File Info "Hidden cells" counter updates after cleaning.

## v1.92
- Font editor: renamed font width modes from "6 high/6 low/4 high/4 low" to "6 (left)/6 (right)/4 (left)/4 (right)" for clarity.
- Fix: FZX-to-fixed font conversion no longer cuts off glyphs with non-zero shift. The shift offset was applied twice (once in the bitmap storage, once in the conversion loop), causing shifted glyphs to be pushed down and truncated.
- Optimize Attributes — new tool in the Xform tab for SCR format. Automatically flips ink↔paper and inverts bitmap in cells where the assignment is suboptimal. The displayed colors remain identical; only the bitmap polarity changes. Four modes: Paper = lighter color (brightness rule), Paper = majority pixels (fill rule), Combined (brightness + majority), Minimize ink bits (compression-friendly). Useful for cleaning up images converted from other software.
- Cell Invert tool (J) — new drawing tool that swaps ink↔paper and inverts bitmap for individual cells. Click or drag across cells to manually flip their polarity without changing displayed colors. Each cell is only inverted once per stroke (no flicker on revisited cells). Available for SCR, IFL, MLT, BMC4, BSC, GMX, and Gigascreen formats.
- GMX display — changed from horizontal squeeze (640→320, scaleX=0.5) to vertical stretch (scaleY=2). All 640 horizontal pixels are now visible; each row is doubled vertically to maintain correct aspect ratio. Previously, nearest-neighbor 2:1 horizontal downscale dropped every other pixel column, making thin text and single-pixel lines invisible.
- GMX 640×200 import quality — source image is now imported at native 640×200 resolution instead of being pre-scaled to 320×200 and doubled. This preserves fine detail (thin text, single-pixel lines) from high-resolution sources.
- File Info counters (update live during editing):
  - **Colors used** — distinct attribute values for attribute formats (SCR, IFL, MLT, BMC4, GMX, etc.); distinct palette indices for NXI/SL2 and LoRes formats.
  - **Hidden cells** — cells where ink equals paper but bitmap is not all 0x00 or all 0xFF. Not shown for attribute-only formats with fixed bitmaps (GMX 160, HLR, 53c, STL).

## v1.91
- GMX 640×200 image import — convert PNG/JPG/GIF to Scorpion ZS 256 hi-res format. Source image is stretched to 320×200 display size, internally doubled to 640×200 for 8×1 attribute cells. Supports all dithering methods including cell-aware variants. Output: 32768-byte `.c` file with linear bitmap and attributes.
- GMX 160×200 image import — convert to Scorpion ZS 256 attribute-only format. Fixed 0x0F bitmap pattern provides 160 color columns. Each 8×1 cell is color-matched to the best ink/paper/bright combination. Dithering is not applicable (bitmap is fixed). Output: 16128-byte `.c` file with "GMX\x0F" header.
- MLT+ULA+ image import — convert to 8×1 multicolor with 64-color ULA+ palette. Auto-generates an optimal 64-color GRB332 palette (4 CLUTs × 16 colors) from the source image, or accepts a user-supplied `.pal` file. Supports all cell-aware and global dithering methods. Output: 12352-byte `.mlt` file (12288 MLT data + 64-byte palette).
- Cell-aware dithering for 8×1 formats — all cell-aware dithering methods (Floyd-Steinberg, Atkinson, Sierra-2, Serpentine, Riemersma, Blue Noise, Pattern, Ordered) now work correctly in 8×1 block converters (MLT, GMX 640×200, MLT+ULA+). Previously only Ordered and None were implemented for 8×1 cells.
- Improved ULA+ palette generation for MLT+ULA+ — color pairs are deduplicated and weighted by frequency before CLUT allocation (the most commonly needed color combinations get priority). CLUT assignment uses perceptual color similarity scoring, and remaining palette slots are filled by grouping similar colors together. This produces significantly more accurate colors compared to the original scan-order greedy approach.
- Tile import support for GMX 640×200, GMX 160×200, and MLT+ULA+ formats — large images can be split into a grid of pictures using the "Tile to screens" feature.
- RAD 6160-byte support — ZX-Uno Radastan files with 16-byte GRB332 embedded palette (6144 pixels + 16 palette bytes) are now loaded and saved correctly, in addition to the existing 6144-byte (no palette) and 6176-byte (RGB333 palette) variants.
- RAD/SLR/SL2 palette save — RAD files that originally contained an embedded palette (GRB332 or RGB333) now preserve it on save. Previously the palette was stripped, saving only the raw pixel data.
- Palette loss warning — when saving SL2, SLR (LoRes), or RAD files that have no embedded palette, a warning is shown if the user has modified palette colors, since custom colors will be lost on reload.
- Fix: importing a ULA+ format (MLT+ULA+, ULA+, ZXP ULA+) after a non-ULA+ picture no longer contaminates the previous picture's palette state.

## v1.90
- Scorpion GMX format support — two Scorpion ZS 256 Turbo graphics modes: GMX 640×200 hi-res (32768 bytes, 8×1 attributes, `.c` extension) and GMX 160×200 attribute-only (16128 bytes, "GMX\x0F" header, `.c` extension). Both formats use standard ZX Spectrum attributes. 640×200 mode renders with PAR 2:1 (half-width pixels) matching the real hardware aspect ratio. 160×200 mode uses implied 0x0F pixel pattern for 160 color columns.
- Scorpion GMX editing — full editing support for both GMX 640×200 and GMX 160×200 formats. GMX 640×200: bitmap + attribute editing (pixel drawing, line, rectangle, circle, flood fill, color picker, text, brushes, layers, undo/redo). GMX 160×200: attribute-only editing (recolor cells, flood fill, color picker). Both formats support save/export round-trip.
- Fix: preview overlays (line, rectangle, circle, selection, paste, brush, text, capture) now render at correct coordinates for formats with non-square pixels (scaleX ≠ 1). Previously, GMX format previews were drawn at double the correct X position.
- Fix: tool preview (line, rectangle, circle, gradient) no longer flickers during drawing. The preview state now persists across all render cycles including the flash timer.
- Fix: MLT+ULA+ files (12352 bytes = 12288 MLT + 64 ULA+ palette) and `.mc` multicolor files now display correctly. Both formats use linear row-major bitmap layout instead of the standard ZX Spectrum interleaved addressing. Added dedicated `mlt_linear` sourceFormat with proper import/export/sync paths. Preview panel now renders MLT formats with correct 8×1 attribute mapping instead of falling through to the SCR renderer.

## v1.89
- Tools tab — new tab in the left panel (View / Edit / Xform / Sprites / Tools) for external SpectraLab pages. Font Editor link moved here from the View tab footer.
- Fix: black area at high zoom (x16+) — the viewport-capped canvas rendering mode left undrawn gaps when overlay scrollbars were active. Raised the full-canvas threshold from 16M to 67M pixels so zoom levels up to x20 use native browser scrolling instead of the sticky-viewport workaround.
- Fix: settings failed to load with "assignment to undeclared variable" errors for `attr53cSortMode` and `nxiSortMode` (variables declared in screen_editor.js but assigned in screen_viewer.js before the editor script loaded).
- Font Editor: Unified glyph array — replaced the separate font/UDG dual-buffer model with a single contiguous glyph buffer supporting up to 1024 glyphs. All glyphs are equal; the artificial font vs. UDG separation is removed.
- Append button — load a font file and append its glyphs after existing ones (up to 1024 total).
- ROM font auto-load — on startup the editor loads the ZX Spectrum ROM font (96 glyphs) from the `fonts/` directory instead of showing an empty 256-glyph grid.
- Glyph count raised to 1024 (was 255). Changing glyph count preserves existing character mapping.
- Removed UDG-specific controls (UDG count input, UDG save formats, UDG new-font options).
- Smart Save — replaced the save format dropdown with context-aware save logic. 96 glyphs saves `.768` directly; 21 glyphs saves `.udg` directly; 256 glyphs shows a Normal/Interlaced dialog (pre-selects current format); 117 glyphs (96+21) shows Single file / Font+UDG / UDG+Font options; >256 glyphs shows a range export dialog with first glyph and count inputs; other counts save `.bin` directly. FZX save unchanged.
- Text Sample responsive wrapping — the preview now fills the available panel width and wraps individual characters to the next line. Adjusts on window resize. Each sample sentence wraps independently, preserving line breaks between them.
- Text Sample Timex mode — new **Timex** checkbox renders text with 2:1 pixel aspect ratio (half-width pixels), simulating the Timex hi-res 512×192 display.
- Stable preview layout — the preview column now uses a fixed width (400px for regular, computed max for FZX), preventing controls from shifting when glyph width changes.

## v1.88
- Font Editor: Drawing tools — Pixel, Line, Rectangle, Circle, and Eraser. Tool buttons in a new "Tools" section with keyboard shortcuts (P/L/R/O/E). Pixel tool retains XOR toggle for backward compatibility. Line, Rectangle, and Circle use drag-to-preview with semi-transparent overlay, release to commit. Eraser clears pixels with Bresenham interpolation for smooth strokes.
- Right-click support: Pixel and Line right-click clear (erase) instead of set. Rectangle and Circle right-click draw filled shapes. Eraser right-click erases a rectangular area (drag to select, release to clear). Preview overlay uses distinct colors: yellow for set, green for filled shapes, red for clear.
- FZX preview enlarged — editable area doubled (fits within 400px instead of 200px), making tall FZX glyphs (e.g. 32px height) easier to edit.
- New/UDG controls remain visible in FZX mode — can create regular fonts or UDG without converting back first.
- Drawing tools work in both regular and FZX modes, respecting active columns, row 0 protection (variable width), and "Whole font" checkbox.
- Shape tools use coordinate clamping at grid edges so dragging to the boundary still commits the shape.

## v1.87
- Font Editor: UDG (User Defined Graphics) support — load, edit, and save UDG blocks (21 characters, A–U, char codes 144–164). Separate UDG glyph count control (0–21). UDG glyphs displayed in the grid after regular font glyphs. UDG data saved alongside the font in supported formats.
- New button with dropdown — create new fonts in 6 configurations (96 glyphs, 256 glyphs, 96+UDG, 256+UDG, custom glyph count, new FZX font).
- Save format dropdown — choose output format (`.768`, `.ch8`, `.bin`, `.fnt`, `.fzx`) instead of a single Save button.
- Glyph count controls in the controls column (right of preview). Unified "Glyphs" input works for both fixed-width and FZX fonts (replaces separate "Last char" FZX control).
- Convert between fixed and FZX formats — "→ FZX" / "→ Fixed" button. Fixed→FZX calculates visual bounding box per glyph, sets width to actual content width, and left-aligns the bitmap. FZX→Fixed clips to 8×8, applies shift offsets.
- Labels checkbox — shows the mapped character below each glyph in the grid (regular, UDG, and FZX modes).
- Align transforms — Align Left, Right, Top, Bottom added to the Transform dropdown. Each shifts glyph pixels until the outermost non-empty row/column touches the edge. Works for both fixed-width and FZX glyphs.
- Copy/paste glyphs — Ctrl+C copies the selected glyph, Ctrl+V pastes. Works within and across fixed/FZX modes with automatic format conversion (fixed→FZX adjusts width/bitmap, FZX→fixed clips to 8×8).
- Visual font format chooser — when loading a 2048-byte file, a modal shows side-by-side previews of both normal and interlaced interpretations (16 glyphs per row × 4 rows). Click to choose instead of the old confirm() dialog.
- Variable width improvements — pixel editing respects active columns per width mode. Row 0 (width byte) is protected from editing in variable mode. "Hide W" checkbox (default: checked) hides the width byte in the grid, pixel editor, and text sample preview. Switching from 4-low or 6-low to variable mode sets width bytes to the corresponding value (4 or 6) instead of defaulting to 8.
- Whole font pixel editing — when "Whole font" is checked, clicking pixels in the editor applies the change to all glyphs (including UDG). Respects per-glyph variable width boundaries.
- Arrow key navigation — Left/Right/Up/Down arrow keys navigate between glyphs in the grid.

## v1.86
- Font Editor: FZX proportional font format support. Load, edit, and save `.fzx` files — ZX Spectrum proportional fonts with variable glyph width (1–16px), configurable height (1–16px), per-glyph shift and kern properties, and signed tracking. Variable-width glyph grid with flexbox layout, dynamic-size pixel editor canvas, per-glyph width/shift/kern controls, font-level height/tracking/lastchar controls. Transforms (invert, clear, scroll, flip) adapted for variable-width bitmaps. "New FZX Font" button for creating fonts from scratch.
- Undo/redo support (Ctrl+Z / Ctrl+Y / Ctrl+Shift+Z). Snapshot-based: covers pixel editing, all transforms, glyph count change, width changes, and all FZX property edits (height, tracking, lastchar, glyph width, shift, kern). Up to 50 undo levels. History is cleared on font load or "New FZX Font". Works across mode switches (fixed ↔ FZX). Keyboard shortcuts use physical key codes, so they work on any keyboard layout (e.g. Russian).

## v1.85
- Font Editor: standalone page (`font_editor.html`) for editing ZX Spectrum 8×8 bitmap fonts. Load/save .768/.ch8/.bin/.SpecCHR/.fnt files (96 or 256 glyphs), exploded format support. Pixel editor with 20× zoom, glyph grid with 4× scale. 22 transforms (bold, italic, shift, flip, rotate). Width modes (8/6/4/variable). Character mapping with Cyrillic remap. Metrics export/import (.metrics JSON). Keyboard shortcuts (B=bold, I=invert, Del=clear). Dark/light theme synced with SpectraLab. Open via Font Editor link in the View tab Font section.

## v1.84
- Fix: image import brightness slider was silently set to a non-zero value by auto-brightness detection, causing incorrect bright/dark attribute assignment when re-importing ZX Spectrum screen exports as PNG. Brightness now defaults to 0 when the import dialog opens
- Fix: brightness and contrast value labels in the import dialog were not updating when moving the sliders (unlike saturation, gamma, sharpness, and smoothing which updated correctly)
- Fix: BSC/BMC4 image import — border color runs were snapped to a fixed 24px grid instead of starting at any 8px cell boundary. Now each 8px cell is color-matched independently, then short interior runs (< 24px) are merged into their longest neighbor
- Fix: BSC/BMC4 image import — border run merging could cause an infinite loop freezing the browser tab
- Fix: import preview size label now updates to show actual output dimensions when changing target format (e.g. "384x304" for BSC instead of always showing "256x192")


## v1.83
- Fix: Bright/Flash checkboxes in the Edit tab could disappear after editing NXI/SL2/LoRes formats and switching back to SCR

## v1.82
- Fix: paper grid no longer extends into the border area for BSC, BMC4, and BSP-with-border formats (grid now covers only the 256×192 paper region)
- Fix: painting on BSC border with a large brush no longer corrupts paper area pixels (brush strokes near border edges are now clamped to valid border coordinates)
- Load palette from text file: accept 15 colors (black auto-prepended as index 0) in addition to 16. Added `RRGGBB` (without `#`), `#AARRGGBB`, and `AARRGGBB` (alpha ignored) hex format support.

## v1.81
- Load external palette from text file: click the 📂 button next to the Palette dropdown to load a custom 16-color palette from a `.txt`, `.pal`, or `.csv` file. Supports `#RRGGBB` hex and `R G B` decimal formats (one color per line, comments with `;` or `//`). The custom palette appears as "Custom (loaded)" in the dropdown; reverts on page reload.

## v1.80
- Next palette color editing: **Ctrl+click** on any cell in the NXI/SL2/LoRes/LoRes Radastan palette grid to open the RGB333 color editor dialog (R: 0-7, G: 0-7, B: 0-7 sliders, original/new color preview, palette index display). Supports undo/redo.

## v1.79
- Save all pictures (Xform tab, visible when 2+ pictures are open):
  - **ZIP (originals)** — bundles every open picture in its native binary
    format into one `spectralab_pictures.zip`. Existing file extensions are
    preserved; duplicate names are disambiguated with " (2)", " (3)", …
  - **ZIP (PNG / GIF)** — bundles every picture rendered with current view
    settings (zoom, border, palette, filters) as PNG; flashing pictures
    become 2-frame animated GIFs at the FLASH_INTERVAL cadence
  - **Animated GIF** — combines all pictures into one animated GIF at
    500 ms / frame; flashing pictures contribute two frames (normal + swapped
    phase). Requires every picture to render to the same canvas size
  - **SCA** — combines all pictures into one SCA animation file at
    500 ms / frame; requires every picture to be in plain SCR format
    (256×192, 6912 bytes), border colour taken from current setting
- Image import: multi-select and "Add All" batch import
  - File open dialog and drag-and-drop now accept multiple images at once
  - First image opens in the standard import dialog; remaining images are queued
  - New "Add All (N)" button imports every queued image with the current dialog
    settings (dithering, format, levels, etc.), creating one Picture per file
  - If the number of selected images exceeds free picture slots, extras are
    skipped so the picture limit (15) is respected
  - Tile-to-screens mode is incompatible with Add All; a prompt asks the user
    to disable it first
- Fix: thin black line below the picture in the viewer
  - `#canvasWrapper` (inline-block) sat on the text baseline of its block
    parent `.editor-canvas-container`, leaving a ~3–4 px descender gap below
    it through which the container's `background: #000` showed as a black
    line. Added `font-size: 0; line-height: 0` to `.editor-canvas-container`
    to collapse the line-box descender.
- ZIP archive picker: multi-select and "Add All"
  - Click to select, Ctrl+click to toggle, Shift+click for range; double-click
    imports a single file immediately
  - Keyboard shortcuts: Escape cancels, Ctrl+A selects all, Enter imports
    selected
  - "Add All" button imports every file listed in the archive
  - Native formats (SCR, BSC, SCA, etc.) are loaded directly; image files route
    through the import dialog with the remaining files queued for "Add All"
  - Selection count shown on the Import button ("Import (N)")
  - MAX_PICTURES limit (15) is respected; a prompt warns if selection exceeds
    free slots

## v1.78
- Image import:
  - Error-diffusion Strength slider (0-100%) and Serpentine scanning checkbox
    - Strength scales how much quantization error is propagated (0 = pure quantize, 100 = classic diffusion)
    - Serpentine alternates row direction during error diffusion to reduce horizontal banding
    - Applies to all global error-diffusion methods (Floyd-Steinberg, Atkinson, Jarvis, Stucki, Burkes, Sierra variants, Serpentine, Riemersma)
    - For ordered/pattern/blue-noise methods: strength > 0 enables hybrid ordered+diffusion mode (GrafX2-style)
  - "Ordered 2x2" dither option (coarsest Bayer pattern, 4 levels per axis)
  - "Dizzy" dither option (Liam Appelbe, 2023)
    - Error diffusion with a dynamic denominator normalized over in-bounds unprocessed neighbors (orthogonal weight 1.0, diagonal 0.1)
    - Blue-noise-like patterns; no error lost at image edges; honors Strength / Serpentine
  - "a-dither" option (arithmetic dither, FFmpeg libswscale formula: `((x + y*236) * 119) & 0xff`)
    - Hash-based per-pixel threshold — spatially stable, blue-noise-like, no lookup table
    - Works as an ordered method (Strength = 0); Strength > 0 engages hybrid ordered+diffusion
  - Internal refactor unified 10+ dithering dispatch sites into a single `applyGlobalDither()` helper
- Internal: readability and maintainability refactor
  - BSC/BMC4 border renderers now share a single `createBorderRenderers(ctx)` factory
    - Eliminates ~100 lines of duplicated nested helpers (`drawColorSegment`, `drawBorderLine`, `drawSideBorderLine`)
  - New `ATTR` helper object centralizes ZX Spectrum attribute-byte bit layout
    - `ATTR.ink(b)`, `ATTR.paper(b)`, `ATTR.bright(b)`, `ATTR.flash(b)`, `ATTR.make(...)` with named mask/bit constants
    - Replaces scattered `& 0x07`, `>> 3`, `& 0x40`, `& 0x80` magic numbers
  - BMC4 attribute bank interleave extracted to `bmc4AttrsFromBanks()` / `bmc4AttrsToBanks()`
    - Deduplicates 3 identical inline loops (import, export, sync)
  - `export53c()` ink/paper normalization extracted to `normalizeAttrForPaint()` helper
  - ASM export download boilerplate unified into `runAsmExport(defaultName, generate)` helper
    - 7 export entry points across 7 files (BSC, ULA+, IFL, Gigascreen, RGB3, LoRes/Radastan, Next L2) collapsed to one-liners
  - Picture format dispatch replaced with `PICTURE_FORMAT_HANDLERS` registry table
    - Single source of truth maps format → import/export handlers; eliminates two parallel switch statements
  - `initEditor()` split: keyboard shortcuts (~183 lines) and attribute-preview flash loop (~27 lines) extracted to focused helpers
- Fix: SPECSCII preview with attrs display off now matches SCR (bright white paper, not muted)
  - Both paths (editor/multi-layer and stream-based) were using `ZX_PALETTE.REGULAR[7]` = rgb(215,215,215)
  - Now use `ZX_PALETTE.BRIGHT[7]` = rgb(255,255,255), matching SCR's hardcoded attrs-off color
- Fix: SPECSCII export no longer emits `INVERSE` control codes (0x14) unless the picture actually uses inverse
  - Previously a leading `14 00` was always written; now all inverse emissions are skipped if no cell uses inverse mode
  - If inverse is used anywhere, the stream emits codes as before
- Fix: Transform → Convert now correctly refreshes tool palette for every format combination
  - Tool/brush/snap visibility is re-applied after each conversion (was stale from previous format)
  - 53c and SPECSCII blocks now reset all tool buttons instead of only hiding their own excluded set
- Fix: snap control now visible (and adjustable) in Next modes (NXI/SL2/SLR/Radastan)
  - Previously hidden while snap still applied during pixel drawing — set Snap to Off for pixel-perfect editing
- Fix: Next/ULA+ palette swap and copy now preserve already drawn colors
  - Next (NXI/SL2/LoRes/Radastan): swap remaps all pixel indices idx1↔idx2; copy remaps
    pixels from the destination slot to any other slot holding the same color (so the
    destination can be safely overwritten without changing the picture visually)
  - ULA+: attribute cells are remapped within their existing CLUT to match the original
    ink/paper RGB values using the new palette (bright/flash untouched)
  - Picture appearance remains stable while reorganizing the palette
- Next palette (NXI/SL2/SLR/Radastan):
  - Sort controls for palette grid display (Index / Hue / RGB + Reverse)
    - Display-only reorder; does not mutate palette bytes
    - Preference persists via localStorage
  - Shift+click copy/swap workflow (same as ULA+)
    - Shift+click a cell to mark source; click another cell to copy, Shift+click to swap
    - Escape cancels the operation
    - Undoable; for NXI the embedded palette bytes are kept in sync

## v1.77
- GIF import:
  - "Import as Flash" for 2-frame animated GIFs
    - Converts two frames into a single SCR with FLASH attributes (bit 7)
    - Brute-force per-cell optimization: tries all ink/paper/bright combinations across both frames
    - Identical cells remain static (no flash); differing cells use FLASH to alternate ink↔paper
    - Flash timer auto-starts on load
  - "Import as Animation" for multi-frame animated GIFs
    - Converts all frames to SCA animation format
    - All GIFs now open through the import dialog with mode dropdown
- Image import:
  - Consolidated import buttons into single Import button with mode dropdown
    - Dropdown shows Picture/Flash/Animation options based on GIF frame count
  - Stable dialog size when switching Image/Adjustments tabs
    - Tab panels use CSS grid overlap so both tabs contribute to container height
  - Reset button on adjustment tab
    - Resets all 11 controls (contrast, brightness, saturation, gamma, sharpness, smoothing, levels, color balance) to defaults
- Fix: SCR → SPECSCII conversion preserves hidden-pixel bitmap patterns
  - Cells with ink == paper now match the bitmap to the best glyph instead of forcing space
  - Character data is preserved for later editing when colors are changed
- Fix: image import as 53c/127c with asymmetric patterns (DD/77, stripes)
  - Paper rule (darker/lighter) no longer swaps ink/paper without inverting the pattern
  - Fixes wrong colors when using non-checker patterns
- UI: 53c Pattern / Blend colors controls moved to the top of View Settings
  - Previously shown as a separate section below Display Filters
  - Now grouped with other view-related controls when a 53c/atr picture is loaded

## v1.76
- SPECSCII character palette: sort by visual weight mode
  - Toggle button (Sort) switches between Code order and Weight order (default)
  - Weight mode sorts ROM characters by pixel popcount (lightest→heaviest)
  - Block graphics displayed in 5×3 symmetric grid
  - Character palette is collapsible (state persists via localStorage)
  - Sort preference persists via localStorage
- SCR → SPECSCII conversion (Transform tab)
  - Matches each 8×8 cell bitmap to best ROM character or block graphic
  - Preserves brightness and flash attributes
  - Handles hidden pixels (ink == paper) as solid color cells
  - Tries both normal and inverted (ink/paper swap) matching

- Image import: Nirvana btile/wtile target formats
  - btile: 16×16 pixel tiles (2×2 cells), variable canvas size divisible by 16
  - wtile: 24×16 pixel tiles (3×2 cells), variable canvas width divisible by 24
  - 8×2 multicolor attribute cells (Nirvana engine format)
  - Supports all dithering modes, brightness/contrast/saturation adjustments
  - Width and height snap to tile-aligned values automatically
- Image import: improved size input controls
  - Tile-aligned snapping deferred to Enter/blur (no longer fights user while typing)
  - Preview updates debounced (300ms) to avoid slow re-renders on every keystroke
- Fix: SPECSCII rendering with attributes off now shows black ink on white paper (matching SCR behavior)

## v1.75
- ULANext SCR support (ZX Spectrum Next extended palette mode)
  - View and edit `.scr` files with ULANext palette (6912 SCR + ink mask + RGB333 palette)
  - Configurable ink mask ($01–$FF) splits attribute byte between ink/paper indices
  - Supports all 8 valid masks: 2/128, 4/64, 8/32, 16/16, 32/8, 64/4, 128/2, 256/1 ink/paper

- Documentation: added Format ASM Export section to help and tutorial (EN/RU) covering all format-level ASM exports

## v1.72
- Gigascreen and RGB3 display mode dropdown with three options:
  - **Blend dark** (default) — simulates perceived brightness on real CRT hardware, accounting for vertical retrace blanking (CRT dark factor 0.8)
  - **Blend** — full-brightness color mixing (Gigascreen: average of two frames; RGB3: direct RGB channel mapping at full palette intensity)
  - **Emulate flicker** — alternating frame display to simulate real hardware
- RGB3 preview in the editor now uses the same rendering as the main canvas, respecting the selected display mode
- Renamed Gigascreen "Average" mode to "Blend" for consistency with RGB3

## v1.71
- ZX Spectrum Next Layer 2 extended mode support:
  - NXI 320×256 (82432 bytes, 8bpp column-major with 256-color palette)
  - NXI 640×256 (81952 bytes, 4bpp column-major with 16-color palette)

  - File size based auto-detection for NXI; interactive mode selection for ambiguous SL2
  - Full editing support for all three Layer 2 modes (256×192, 320×256, 640×256)
  - 640×256 mode displays with 2× vertical stretch (half-width pixels on real hardware)
  - Per-picture Layer 2 mode preserved when switching between open pictures
- Image Import: NXI 320×256, NXI 640×256, SL2 320×256, SL2 640×256 added as target formats
- Format conversions for Next Layer 2 extended modes:

## v1.70
- Import animated GIF to SCA animation with frame delay preservation
  - Multi-frame GIFs are automatically detected and decoded with full GIF87a/GIF89a support
  - Each frame is converted to ZX Spectrum SCR format (Floyd-Steinberg dithering) and assembled into an SCA animation
  - Per-frame delays from the GIF are converted to SCA 20ms delay units
  - Supports disposal methods, transparency, interlaced frames, local color tables, and non-standard sizes
  - Single-frame GIFs continue to use the existing Image Import dialog
  - After import, full SCA editor access: filmstrip, playback, trim, delay editing, optimize, export

  - 256-color palette grid (16×16), left click = ink, right click = paper
  - Drawing tools: Pixel, Line, Rectangle, Circle, Airbrush, Gradient, Flood Fill, Eraser, Color Picker
  - Undo/redo with palette state preservation; save back to .nxi/.sl2

## v1.66
- New Picture and Image Import format dropdowns grouped with `<optgroup>` dividers for better navigation
  - Standard (256×192), With border (384×304), Gigascreen, Tricolor/Monochrome, Text & attributes, Variable size
- Image Import improvements:
  - SPECSCII charset selector — choose which glyphs are used during conversion: Full (ROM + blocks, 112 glyphs), ASCII (ROM only, 96), UDG (blocks only, 16 + space)
  - Default preview zoom changed from x2 to x1
  - Fixed bottom controls (Zoom, Grid, Cancel/Import) being clipped on smaller screens

## v1.65
- BSP (Border Screen with Header) format support: load, view, edit, create, save, and image import
  - 4 variants: screen-only, screen+border, gigascreen, gigascreen+border
  - New Picture, Image Import, format conversions (BSC↔BSP, BSP→SCR), ZIP loading

## v1.64
- STL (Stellar) format support: view, edit, create, save — 64×48 fat-pixel gigascreen with fixed bitmap pattern; New Picture, ZIP loading
- Image Import: SPECSCII output format — converts images to 32×24 character grid using ROM font glyphs and block graphics
- ULA+ palette copy/swap: Shift+click to copy or swap palette cells; works in Grid and Classic views; undoable

## v1.63
- ULA+ palette import: added support for 176-byte `.tap` palette loaders (BASIC + MC programs, e.g. from sourcesolutions.itch.io/ulaplus10); 64-byte GRB332 palette is extracted from offset 110, validated by 0D 0A trailer
  - Works in both the editor palette Load button and the Image Import palette source file picker

## v1.62
- Memory Viewer button moved from the Sprites sidebar tab to the View tab (below File Info), so it's visible right after loading a snapshot without having to switch tabs
- New Picture dialog: added `chr$` (mono) and `chr$ gigascreen` formats with configurable width/height (8–2040 px per axis, 8×8 attribute cells); palette selector is hidden for chr$ since ULA+ is not supported

## v1.61
- HLR (Gigascreen Lowres) format support: read, view, edit, save, and create new .hlr files
  - 1628-byte self-contained ZX Spectrum loader with two attribute banks (768 bytes each) and an 8-byte bitmap fill pattern
  - Loader disassembly documented in ZX_SPECTRUM_GRAPHICS_GUIDE.md
  - Renders via the existing two-frame gigascreen renderer; default pattern FF FF FF FF 00 00 00 00 produces a 32×48 grid of 8×4 top/bottom half-cells
  - File detection by extension and by exact 1628-byte size; new HLR option in the New Picture dialog
  - Pattern-aware load/edit/save: the 8-byte pattern is read from file offset 0x54, stored on the picture, and written back on save
  - Custom fill patterns (non-default) are preserved across load/edit/save, enabling arbitrary 8×8 ink/paper masks per cell
  - Editor drawing tools read the pattern bit at (x%8, y%8) to decide whether a click targets the cell's ink or paper component
  - Fill and recolor tools set both ink and paper of the cell to a single color (solid mode)
  - Save writes the 84-byte Z80 loader, the picture's 8-byte pattern, and both attribute banks
- HLR fill pattern UI: full pattern picker for new and existing HLR pictures
  - New Picture dialog: when HLR is selected, a "Fill pattern" row offers presets (top/bottom halves, left/right halves, checkerboard 1×1 / 2×2, horizontal/vertical stripes 1px / 2px, diagonals) plus a custom 8-byte hex input and a live 8×8 preview
  - Last-used preset and custom hex are remembered via localStorage
  - Editor: "Edit HLR fill pattern..." button inside the Gigascreen color section opens a dialog with the same presets / hex input / preview, pre-filled from the current picture
  - Applying a new pattern rewrites the bitmap in all frames and plane buffers while leaving both attribute banks untouched, so only the ink/paper mask changes
  - Pattern changes go through the undo/redo stack (undo state now carries the 8-byte HLR pattern)

## v1.60
- Image import: added Gigascreen (.img) and MGH (.mg8/.mg4/.mg2/.mg1) output formats
  - PNG/JPG/GIF/WebP/BMP can now be converted directly to two-frame gigascreen with up to 4 perceived colors per cell
  - Per-cell brute-force search over ~2628 unique attribute-pair quads finds the best (attr1, attr2) blend for each cell
  - Supports both global dithering (Floyd-Steinberg, Atkinson, ordered, etc. against the 136-color blended palette) and cell-aware dithering (Floyd/Atkinson/Ordered/None inside each cell using its 4 chosen blend colors)
  - Tile import works for all gigascreen variants
  - Imported pictures open directly in the gigascreen editor as 2-plane pictures with the correct attrCellHeight (8/4/2/1)
- Editing support for all Multiartist MGH modes: mg1, mg2, mg4, mg8 now fully editable
  - mg2 uses 8×2 attribute cells (3072 attrs per frame)
  - mg1 uses 8×1 attribute cells: inner columns 8-23 have per-pixel-row attrs, outer columns 0-7/24-31 use 8×8 cells
  - mg1 export correctly splits attrs into inner (3072 bytes) + outer (384 bytes) sections per frame
  - Editor enforces 8×8 attr constraint on mg1 outer columns (draw/fill/recolor replicate attrs across 8-row blocks)
  - All MGH modes use interleaved bitmap layout, all editor tools work correctly
  - Save produces valid .mg1/.mg2/.mg4/.mg8 files with 256-byte MGH header
- New Picture dialog: added mg8, mg4, mg2, mg1 format options for creating blank Multiartist gigascreen pictures
- mg1 viewer: dashed orange boundary lines in border area mark inner section (columns 8-23) vs outer (0-7, 24-31)
- Editing support for Multiartist mg4 format: .mg4 files now open in the editor with full gigascreen 4-color editing
  - mg4 uses 8×4 attribute cells (1536 attrs per frame) with standard gigascreen interleaved bitmap layout
  - All editor tools (draw, fill, recolor, color picker, layers, undo/redo) work with 8×4 cell height
  - Save produces valid .mg4 file with 256-byte MGH header
- Format info now shows specific MGH mode (mg1/mg2/mg4/mg8) instead of generic "MGH"
- Editing support for Multiartist mg8 format: .mg8 files now open in the editor with full gigascreen 4-color editing
  - mg8 screenData uses standard gigascreen interleaved layout, reusing all existing editor code
  - Save produces valid .mg8 file with 256-byte MGH header
  - ASM export (Pentagon dual-screen) available for mg8
- Multiartist MGH format support: read-only loading of .mg1/.mg2/.mg4/.mg8 multicolor gigascreen files
  - 256-byte header with "MGH" signature, mode byte selects attr cell height (1/2/4/8 lines)
  - Two-frame gigascreen with multicolor attributes, rendered via flicker or average blending
  - Gigascreen renderer now respects per-picture attrCellHeight instead of hardcoded 8×8
- Fix: ZXP and chr$ files (.ch$, .chr$, .ch-) now load correctly from ZIP archives

## v1.59.3
- 53c/127c palette: added sort mode controls (Hue, RGB, Color) and Reverse toggle
  - Hue: groups by hue bucket then luminance (previous default behavior)
  - RGB: sorts by blended R/G/B value
  - Color: sorts by attribute byte (ink, paper, bright)
  - Reverse checkbox flips the sort order
  - Selected color is preserved when changing sort mode or pattern
  - Sort preference persists via localStorage
- Grid color presets: added "Grid color" dropdown in View Settings (Default, White, Gray, Black, Orange, Red, Green)
  - Applies to paper grid, subgrid, and border grid on the main canvas
  - Useful for visibility on dark or light artwork
  - Setting persists via localStorage
- Fix: 53c editor preview thumbnail not updating while drawing (updated only on next stroke)
- 53c/127c/SCA type 1: added "Blend colors" checkbox next to pattern selector
  - When checked, each cell renders as a solid averaged color instead of a dither pattern
  - Palette swatches also display solid blended colors in blend mode
  - Works across all 53c rendering paths: standalone viewer, Picture-based renderer, and SCA type 1 animation frames
  - Setting persists via localStorage

## v1.59.2
- SCA editor: replaced Save/Export buttons with dropdown (SCA, SCR zip, 53c zip, GIF, PNG zip) + Save button
  - Added animated GIF export with per-frame delay from SCA timing
  - Added PNG series export (numbered PNGs in a ZIP archive)
  - Replaced JSZip dependency with built-in ZIP creator for SCR/53c/PNG exports
- Fix: editor mouse coordinate offset at zoom ×4+ when canvas exceeds viewport (affected .atr and other formats)
  - `canvasToScreenCoords` no longer double-counts scroll offset when canvas is full logical size
- Fix: .53c export now normalizes attributes so ink ≥ paper (ChunkyPaint compatibility)
  - Swaps ink/paper when paper > ink; checkerboard pattern is symmetric so visual result is identical

## v1.59.1
- Nirvana .btile/.wtile: open as single variable-size image instead of splitting into multiple 256×192 IFL screens
  - No tile-per-row cap — supports any count (was limited to 16/10)
  - Uses ZXP Picture internally with `attrCellHeight=2` (8×2 multicolor), full editor support
  - Save exports back to .btile/.wtile format (column-major attrs for btile, row-major for wtile)
  - Format info displays "Nirvana btile/wtile (8x2 multicolor)"
- Documentation: added chr$ (Character Array) format to ZX_SPECTRUM_GRAPHICS_GUIDE.md

## v1.59
- chr$ format support: open, view, edit, and save `.ch$`/`.chr$`/`.ch-` files (variable-size, interleaved 8×8 cell format)
  - 7-byte header: "chr$" magic + width/height in cells + bytes-per-cell (9 or 18)
  - Gigascreen chr$ support (bpc=18): two frames per cell, blended rendering
  - Full editor support: drawing, attributes, layers, copy/paste, clear, save
- Image import: added ZXP format with custom width/height (8–2048, ×8), ULA/ULA+ palette type selector
  - Import dialog preview constrained with max-height and scroll for large ZXP dimensions
- New Picture dialog: added ZXP (.zxp) format option with configurable width (8–2048, ×8), height (8–2048, ×8), and palette type (ULA / ULA+)
  - ZXP settings (width, height, palette) persist across dialog opens via localStorage
- Fix: canvas container sizing for non-standard image dimensions
  - Added `width/height: fit-content` to `.editor-canvas-container` — eliminates black gaps around images
  - Reordered `renderScreen()` to set wrapper dimensions before reading container client size

## v1.58.5
- Variable-size ZXP support: ZX-Paintbrush files with non-standard dimensions (8–2048 pixels, divisible by 8)
  - `parseZxpFile()` auto-detects width/height from bitmap line length and count
  - Standard 256×192 ZXP still maps to SCR/IFL/MLT as before
  - Non-standard sizes use new `FORMAT.ZXP` with linear screenData layout (bitmap + attrs)
- New `importZxp()` / `exportZxp()` in picture_format.js for ZXP Picture import/export
- Sync bridge: `syncPictureFromScreenData` / `syncScreenDataFromPicture` handle 'zxp' format (direct linear copy)
- Dynamic dimensions in viewer: `renderScreen()`, `drawCharGrid()`, `drawStandardBorderGrid()` use `currentPicture` dimensions
- Dynamic dimensions in editor: `getFormatWidth()` / `getFormatHeight()` read from `currentPicture`
  - Propagates to bounds checking, preview rendering, fullscreen zoom, clipboard operations
- ZXP save/export outputs text format via `exportZxp()`
- Fix: ZXP drawing placed pixels at wrong positions (drew in two places simultaneously)
  - `getBitmapAddress()` / `getAttributeAddress()` now return linear offsets for FORMAT.ZXP
  - All pixel operations (setPixel, getPixel, setPixelDirect, etc.) use correct addressing
  - Layer attribute updates, fillCell, recolorCell, clearScreen handle ZXP dimensions
  - Copy/paste uses `getAttributeAddress()` and dynamic bounds instead of hardcoded SCREEN constants
- Fix: ZXP editor preview showed black background
  - Added ZXP-specific rendering path in `renderPreview()` with linear bitmap/attr reads
- Fix: pixel info display rejected small ZXP files due to SCREEN.TOTAL_SIZE guard
- Fractional zoom levels (x1/8, x1/4, x1/2) for large images
  - Zoom dropdown, scroll-wheel zoom, and fullscreen zoom all support fractional values
- Performance: viewport-clipped rendering for large images (>512×512)
  - `renderPictureStandard()` only renders the visible viewport region, not the full image
  - ZXP renders directly from screenData, skipping redundant sync to Picture planes
  - Layer bitmap/attribute sizes computed dynamically for ZXP format
- Deferred stroke for big pictures (>512px): smooth curve drawing
  - Mouse path collected during drawing with live smooth Catmull-Rom preview overlay
  - On mouse release, spline interpolation generates a smooth curve through all points
  - Eliminates visible straight-line segments at fractional zoom levels
  - Affects pixel, eraser, and airbrush tools; standard 256×192 pictures use immediate drawing
- Fix: airbrush on normal pictures draws with gaps during fast mouse movement
  - Spray points distributed along movement path between consecutive mouse positions
- Viewport-sized canvas: canvas is capped to the visible viewport area instead of full image × zoom
  - Eliminates huge canvas allocations (e.g., 2048px image at x20 zoom no longer creates a 40960px canvas)
  - Wrapper div provides full logical size for scrollbars; sticky viewport div keeps canvas in view
  - Scroll events trigger re-render via requestAnimationFrame throttling
  - BSC/BMC4 formats bypass viewport capping (always manageable size)

## v1.58.4
- Unified Picture-based renderers: `renderPictureStandard()`, `renderPictureGigascreen()`, `renderPictureRgb3()`
  - Read from `currentPicture` linear layout instead of format-specific `screenData` offsets
  - `renderPictureStandard()` covers SCR, SCR+/ULA+, IFL, MLT, 53c, and Mono formats via parametric `attrCellHeight`
  - `renderPictureGigascreen()` covers Gigascreen with average-blend and flicker modes from 2-plane Picture
  - `renderPictureRgb3()` covers RGB3 with palette LUT average and per-bitplane flicker from 3-plane Picture
- `renderScreen()` dispatcher prefers Picture-based renderers when `currentPicture` exists
  - BSC, BMC4, SPECSCII, and SCA fall through to legacy renderers
  - Legacy format-based renderers retained as fallback for when `currentPicture` is null
- Fix: ULA+ palette lost when loading a second file then closing it
  - `initUlaPlusMode()` was clobbering ULA+ globals before `addPicture()` saved old tab state
  - Now saves current picture state before `initUlaPlusMode` runs; `addPicture` skips redundant save
- Fix: changing 53c pattern dropdown did not refresh the picture
  - Pattern change handler now updates `currentPicture.pattern` before rendering

## v1.58.3
- Internal Picture format: all formats now populate `currentPicture` on load
  - Import converters: IFL, MLT, Mono (full/2-3/1-3), BSC, BMC4, Gigascreen, RGB3, 53c, SPECSCII
  - Export converters: matching export for all formats
  - Unified `importPicture()` / `exportPicture()` dispatchers
- Extended Picture typedef with `contentMode`, `colorMode`, `border`, `pattern`, text mode fields
- Generalized sync bridge (`syncPictureFromScreenData` / `syncScreenDataFromPicture`) handles all formats
- Loading pipeline uses `importPicture()` for all formats instead of only SCR/ULA+
- Save/export uses `exportPicture()` when `currentPicture` exists
- Undo/redo re-imports `currentPicture` using unified importer on format changes

## v1.58.2
- Color Picker tool: dedicated toolbar button (⊙) and keyboard shortcut (K)
  - Works across all editable formats: SCR, BSC, IFL, MLT, BMC4, ULA+, Gigascreen, 53c, RGB3, SPECSCII
  - Left-click picks ink/primary color; right-click picks paper/secondary color
  - BSC/BMC4: also picks colors from border area
  - RGB3: picks the actual 3-bit pixel color from R/G/B bitmaps
  - 53c: finds and selects the matching virtual palette entry
  - SPECSCII: picks ink/paper/bright/flash from character cell attributes
- RGB3: dedicated 8-color palette with L/R (left/right button) selection instead of ink/paper
  - Palette shows realistic perceived colors (1/3 brightness per channel due to flicker through black)
  - Tooltips show bitplane composition (e.g. "Cyan (R=0 G=1 B=1)")
- RGB3: canvas rendering now uses palette-aware blended colors instead of pure RGB
  - Non-flicker mode shows averaged color from 3 bitplane frames using current palette
  - Flicker mode uses current palette colors per frame (was hardcoded to default RGB)
  - Both palette and canvas update when switching palettes (Ocean, EmuzWin, etc.)
- Alt+Click color picker now works on all editable formats (was limited to SCR, ULA+, Gigascreen)
- 53c editor: restored drawing tools (line, rectangle, circle, flood fill, eraser, recolor)
  - Tools were incorrectly hidden — airbrush, gradient, text, fill_cell remain unavailable for attribute-only format
  - Shape tools (line, rect, circle) now apply attribute recoloring per cell instead of acting as freehand
  - Flood fill is layer-aware: reads from active layer so filling on empty layers works correctly
  - Keyboard shortcuts (P, L, R, O, A, I, E, K) now work in 53c mode
- 53c editor: layers fully supported — add/remove layers, per-cell mask compositing, flatten
  - Layer bitmap stores attribute bytes; mask tracks which cells are painted per layer
  - Upper layers override lower layers on cells where mask is set
  - Drawing tools write to active layer when layers are enabled
- Fix: 53c palette cell selection no longer causes layout shift (outline instead of border-width change)

## v1.58.1
- Fix: switching tabs showed blank canvas — `addPicture()` saved the NEW picture's `currentPicture` to the OLD tab
  - Root cause: callers set `currentPicture` globally before `addPicture()`, but `saveCurrentPictureState()` inside `addPicture()` captured it for the wrong tab
  - `addPicture()` now accepts an `internalPicture` parameter; `currentPicture` is set AFTER the old tab state is saved
  - All callers updated: `loadScreenFile`, `loadZxpFile`, `createNewPicture`, image import, snapshot loader, project load
- Fix: multiple new SCR screens shared the same internal picture by reference — editing one modified all
  - `saveCurrentPictureState`, `loadPictureState`, and `addPicture` now deep-clone `currentPicture` via `clonePicture()`
- Fix: creating a new blank SCR/ULA+ screen inherited stale `currentPicture` from previously loaded screen
  - `createNewPicture()` now creates a fresh `currentPicture` for SCR and SCR_ULAPLUS formats, and sets null for all others
- Fix: pixel and airbrush tools only showed changes when mouse button was released
  - `renderScrFromPicture` now syncs from `screenData` before rendering, so mid-stroke changes appear immediately
- Fix: flatten layers — undo did not work
  - `layersEnabled` was not saved in undo state; after flatten set it to false, undo restored layers but `layersEnabled` stayed false
- Fix: clear ULA+ screen — undo incorrect (palette not restored)
  - `ulaPlusPalette` was not saved in undo state; clear resets palette to default, but undo only restored `screenData`
- Fix: format conversion (e.g. .atr → .scr) — undo did not work
  - `currentFormat` and `currentFileName` were not saved in undo state; undo stack was cleared on conversion
  - All 7 conversion functions now call `saveUndoState()` before converting and no longer clear undo/redo stacks
  - Undo/redo restore format, filename, ULA+ mode, `currentPicture`, and update all format-dependent UI
- Fix: converting .atr → .scr did not switch color picker from pattern palette to standard palette
  - `toggle53cColorPicker(false)` was asymmetric — hid .53c palette but didn't restore standard color section
  - All conversion functions now call `updateEditorColorPickers()` to switch color pickers correctly
- Fix: after opening .sca via file picker, then loading a picture format file — editor tools not shown
  - SCA file picker path did not call `updateEditorState()`, leaving `editorActive = true`; subsequent picture load skipped `setEditorEnabled(true)`
- SCA type 1: pattern selector now shown — can switch between File (embedded), Checker, Stripes, and Pattern views
  - Reuses the 53c pattern dropdown; "File" option appears only for SCA type 1 and shows the embedded fill pattern
  - Pattern change updates both the main viewer and SCA editor preview

## v1.58.0
- Internal picture format (Step 1 — SCR proof of concept)
  - New `js/picture_format.js` module: linear row-major bitmap + attribute storage for ZX Spectrum screens
  - SCR deinterleave/interleave: converts between ZX Spectrum's interleaved memory layout and linear row-major order
  - Import/export for standard SCR (6912 bytes) and SCR+ULA+ (6976 bytes with 64-byte GRB332 palette)
  - New `renderScrFromPicture` renderer reads from linear bitmap — pixel-identical output to the original `renderScrFast`
  - Dual-representation with sync: editor still writes to `screenData`, `syncCurrentPicture()` copies changes to internal format after each action (draw, undo, redo, fill, paste, clear, flatten, format conversion)
  - `currentPicture` stored per tab in the multi-picture system — switching tabs preserves the internal format
  - Save/export path uses `exportScr`/`exportScrUlaPlus` when internal format is available
  - All entry points covered: file open, drag-drop, ZXP import, image import, snapshot extraction, project/workspace load
  - Non-SCR formats (IFL, MLT, BSC, BMC4, RGB3, Gigascreen, Mono, SPECSCII, SCA) unaffected — `currentPicture` is null, old renderers used

## v1.57.1
- ZXP (ZX-Paintbrush) file format support (partial — 256×192 only)
  - Load `.zxp` text-based image files via file picker or drag-and-drop
  - Auto-detects attribute mode from line count: 8×8 (SCR), 8×4 (IFL), 8×2 (IFL), 8×1 (MLT)
  - Converts linear bitmap rows to ZX Spectrum interleaved SCR layout
  - Supports optional ULA+ palette (64-byte) → loads as SCR_ULAPLUS
  - 8×4 attributes are expanded (row-doubled) to 8×2 IFL format

## v1.57.0
- 53c/127c editor: pattern color palette
  - Replaces standard ink/paper picker when editing .53c/.atr files
  - Grid of unique dither-pattern swatches showing actual ink/paper colors through the selected pattern
  - Click a swatch to select that color combination for painting
  - Adapts to current pattern: Checker (~53 colors), DD77 (~127 colors), Stripes (~53 colors)
  - Rebuilds automatically when switching patterns or palettes
- New Picture dialog remembers last used format

## v1.56.1
- Light/Dark theme switching
  - Toggle button (&#9790;/&#9788;) next to the Help button
  - Respects OS `prefers-color-scheme` on first visit
  - Setting persists to localStorage
  - FOUC prevention via inline `<head>` script
  - Canvas viewer colors adapt per theme (grid, labels, backgrounds)
  - Editor canvas previews (brush slots, tile cells, barcode, SPECSCII palette) adapt to current theme

## v1.56.0
- Display Filters: new collapsible section in the View tab with CRT/retro post-processing effects
  - **Scanlines** — Gaussian beam profile with brightness-dependent width (modeled after crt-geom/crt-lottes emulator shaders)
  - **Noise** — static film grain with optional animation (~12 fps)
  - **Composite** — chroma blur simulating composite video color bleed (YCbCr horizontal box blur)
  - **Phosphor Glow** — blurred screen-blend overlay simulating phosphor persistence
  - **Vignette** — radial gradient darkening at screen edges
  - **CRT Curvature** — barrel distortion simulating curved CRT glass
  - **Pixel Smoothing** — toggle bilinear interpolation for softer pixel scaling
  - **Presets** — None, CRT TV, Composite, VHS, Arcade
  - Master **On** checkbox to bypass all filters without losing settings
  - Settings persist to localStorage and workspace (.slw) files
- Fullscreen mode
  - Now works in both viewer and editor modes (previously editor-only)
  - **F11** — toggle fullscreen from any tab
  - **Escape** — exit fullscreen
  - Viewer fullscreen shows only the canvas with active display filters
  - Editor fullscreen shows floating tool palette and preview panel
- Zoom: Ctrl+Mouse Wheel now zooms toward cursor position

## v1.55.0
- Drag-and-drop: drop any supported file anywhere on the window to open it (same as Browse — handles .scr, .png, .zip, .slp, .slw, snapshots, etc.)
- Nirvana tiles
  - Tiles-per-row dialog now defaults to the actual tile count instead of always 16
  - Large tile files that exceed one screen are split across multiple IFL pictures automatically
- Sprite editor
  - **Clear all** button to delete all spritesets at once (with confirmation)
  - W/H and Mode controls are always visible, so grab parameters are accessible even when no spriteset is selected
- Documentation
  - Clarified sprite/spriteset terminology (spriteset = named entry with frames, sprite = individual frame)
  - Separated Nirvana tile format from generic custom sprite data layouts in ZX_SPECTRUM_GRAPHICS_GUIDE.md

## v1.54.0
- Sprite editor
  - Multicolour sub-modes — **Multicolour 8×1**, **8×2**, and **8×4** attribute cell heights, selectable from the Mode dropdown
  - Switching between multicolour sub-modes resamples attributes to the new resolution
  - **Attr scroll** checkbox — when enabled, shift arrows (← → ↑ ↓) scroll attributes together with pixels; attributes roll when accumulated shift reaches a cell boundary
  - Attr scroll checkbox hidden in Mono mode
  - Nirvana export warns and skips sprites that are not 8×2 multicolour
  - Save/load preserves `attrCellH` property; old projects default to 8×2
  - Grab from screen respects selected multicolour sub-mode; auto-detect no longer overwrites an already-selected sub-mode
  - **Attributes** checkbox — toggle color display on/off; when unchecked shows black/white bitmap (black = ink, white = paper)
  - Renamed "Attr" checkbox to "Scroll attr" for clarity
- Zoom
  - Ctrl+Mouse Wheel now works anywhere in the right panel area (not just directly over the canvas), preventing accidental browser zoom
  - Ctrl+Mouse Wheel uses accumulator threshold to prevent trackpads from jumping multiple zoom levels at once
- Transform tab (Xform): workspace Save/Load buttons are now always accessible, even without a loaded picture

## v1.53.1
- Image import
  - Fixed ULA+ conversion producing wrong colors when Paper rule is Darker/Lighter (paper rule now skipped for ULA+ which uses independent CLUT halves)
  - Removed Auto option from Paper rule (Darker color is now the default)
- Nirvana tiles
  - Fixed `.btile` import producing wrong colors (attributes are column-major in btile format)
  - Fixed `.wtile` import/export (attributes are row-major, unlike btile which is column-major)
  - Loading `.btile`/`.wtile` now appends to existing sprites instead of replacing them
  - Auto-selects Nirvana export format when loading tile files
- Sprite editor
  - Edit button moved to sprite list toolbar (between Add and Delete) for quicker access
  - Frame bar now shows exactly 16 frames per row
  - Each new grab creates a new sprite instead of appending frames to the existing one
  - Grab reuses the selected sprite if it is empty and matches grab dimensions/mode
  - Grab rectangle snaps to sprite W/H cell dimensions (e.g. 3×2 cells → widths 24, 48, 72… and heights 16, 32, 48…)
  - W/H and Mode locked after drawing content (clear all frames to unlock)
  - Removed duplicate W/H and Mode controls from grab section (grab now uses sprite properties)
  - Cleaned up floating editor layout (Play/Speed aligned right, removed separator lines from tool palette)
  - Binary export warns and aborts when sprites have different sizes or color modes; when multiple sprites share the same size/mode, offers to join into one file or split into separate files
- Workspace: save/load (.slw) now preserves sprite sheet data

## v1.53.0
- Image import
  - **Tile to screens** — split a large source image into a grid of ZX Spectrum pictures covering the entire source
    - Checkbox in Output section enables tiling mode
    - Automatically calculates grid (cols × rows) based on crop area and output format dimensions
    - Edge tiles padded with black to fill full output dimensions
    - Tile naming: `filename_col_row.ext` (e.g. `image_0_0.scr`, `image_1_0.scr`, `image_2_3.scr`)
    - Yellow dashed grid overlay on original canvas shows tile boundaries and labels
    - Per-tile preview with ◄/► navigation — preview shows the actual converted output for each tile
    - Position/Size/Fit/Align controls disabled during tiling (overridden by tile logic)
    - Confirms with user if more tiles than available picture slots
  - Fixed ULA+ conversion producing wrong colors when Paper rule is set to Darker/Lighter
  - Removed Auto option from Paper rule (Darker color is now the default)
- Multi-picture: maximum pictures increased from 8 to 15
- Picture tab bar: fixed overflow when many tabs are open (tabs now shrink and scroll horizontally)

## v1.52.1
- Sprite editor
  - Fixed animation playback not working (stale closure in setInterval callback; fresh sprite reference now fetched each tick)
  - Animation stops when switching to a different sprite
  - Rearranged layout — preview canvas, play/speed, frame navigation and checkboxes moved under main editing canvas
  - Renamed "Spd:" label to "Speed"
- Screen viewer: fixed attributes-off rendering — ink (1 bits) now renders as black, paper (0 bits) as white, matching ZX Spectrum convention (was inverted)
- Image import: fixed paper color rule (Darker/Lighter) for single-color cells — when both ink and paper are the same color, luminance is checked against midpoint to determine if the color should be paper or ink; two-color cells still use relative luminance comparison

## v1.52.0
- Sprite editor
  - Frame bar moved from sidebar to floating editor panel
  - Multi-select frames with Ctrl+Click (toggle) and Shift+Click (range select)
  - Move Left/Right buttons (◄ / ►) to reorder selected frames
  - Del button deletes all selected frames (keeps at least 1)
- Sprite list
  - Multi-select with Ctrl+Click (toggle) and Shift+Click (range select)
  - Right-click context menu with operations:
    - Merge selected to animation — combine selected sprites (same dimensions/mode) into one sprite with multiple frames
    - Add frames to… — copy frames from selected sprites to a chosen target sprite
    - Move frames to… — move frames to a target sprite, removing source sprites
    - Split frames to sprites — split a multi-frame sprite into separate single-frame sprites
    - Delete selected — remove all selected sprites
  - Split/Merge buttons moved from sidebar into the context menu
- Import Nirvana tile files (`.btile`, `.wtile`): opens file, prompts for tiles per row, creates IFL picture with tiles laid out in a grid and a spriteset with each tile as a multicolour sprite

## v1.51.1
- Image import: fixed crash when using Darker/Lighter paper rule (analyzeCell and block analysis functions now return inkRgb/paperRgb needed by perceptual luminance calculation)
- Sprite editor: right mouse button now draws paper (clears pixels), matching main canvas behavior
  - Applies to all drawing tools: Draw, Erase, Line, Rectangle, Fill
  - Left click = ink (set bit), Right click = paper (clear bit)
  - Erase tool inverts: left = clear, right = set
  - Fill tool: left click fills with ink, right click fills with paper
- Sprite grab
  - Fixed black/white sprites when grabbing in multicolour mode (Firefox/Win7) — multicolour `<option>` was hidden from a previous session; Firefox refuses to set `<select>` value to a hidden option, so attr mode silently fell back to mono
  - Fixed drawing on main canvas while dragging grab rectangle — changed `stopPropagation()` to `stopImmediatePropagation()` to prevent editor mousedown from firing; added `spriteGrabMode` guard in screen editor's mousedown handler

## v1.51.0
- Image import
  - Default dithering changed to None (nearest color, no dithering)
  - Paper color rule control: Auto, Darker color, Lighter color, First pixel paper
  - Applied to all formats: SCR, ULA+, IFL, MLT, BMC4, 53c, BSC
  - Skipped for mono output (fixed ink=black, paper=white)

## v1.50.0

  - Grid overlay shows 8x2 cell boundaries in multicolour mode
  - Flip H/V correctly reorders multicolour attribute rows
  - Rotation disabled for multicolour (8x2 cells cannot rotate 90°)
  - Undo/redo handles variable attribute array sizes
  - Export format selector (Raw / Nirvana) shown for multicolour sprites
  - Onion skin fix: now renders on top of current frame (was invisible due to draw order); previous frame's ink pixels only overlaid at 25% opacity (paper pixels skipped)
  - Animation playback fix: zoomed editor canvas now updates during animation (was static, only preview moved)
- Sprite grab from multicolour screens (IFL, MLT, BMC4)
  - Format-aware attribute extraction using correct attribute address functions
  - Attr mode dropdown auto-locked to Multicolour when source is a multicolour format
  - Multicolour option hidden from dropdown when source is non-multicolour
  - Phase grab converts existing frames when attr mode differs from sprite

## v1.49.0
- Image import: alignment control for fitted images
  - Align dropdown with 9 positions: Top-Left, Top, Top-Right, Left, Center, Right, Bottom-Left, Bottom, Bottom-Right
  - Applies to all fit modes: Letterbox, Fill/crop, Fit width, Fit height
  - Both main canvas and BSC canvas respect alignment setting

  - Address navigation: byte, line, row (8 lines), sprite, page steps
  - Vertical scrollbar for fast navigation through memory
  - Mouse wheel scrolling through memory
  - Mouse-driven selection: click to position red rectangle, drag to resize
  - Width/height inputs update live during drag
  - Address label shows effective address of selection in decimal and hex
  - Adjustable sprite size: width (1-8 bytes) and height (1-64 rows)
  - Red selection rectangle movable anywhere within the dump viewport
  - Preview canvas shows selected sprite at 2x zoom
  - Linear and Char addressing modes (char mode uses 8x8 tile layout)
  - Invert display toggle (black on green)
  - Grid overlay (per byte vertical, per 8 rows horizontal)
  - Zoom levels: x1, x2, x3, x4 (default x3)
  - Draggable floating panel (same pattern as sprite editor)
